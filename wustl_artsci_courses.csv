TBA,L90 AFAS 280," In 1903 W.E.B. Du Bois wrote that the ""biggest problem of the 20th Century is the problem of the color line."" By this stage, cinema and photography were already well established technologies that were being used to produce and justify differences between black and white subjects. Collectively through historical and theoretical readings, film screenings, and by engaging with a variety of visual arts practices, in this seminar we will first examine the relationship between early visual technologies and modern understandings of race. Since the development of photography and cinema, scientists, anthropologists, and the state have mobilized such visual technologies to inscribe racialized difference onto black/African/native bodies. Central to our analysis is the manner in which visual technologies have produced the black/African body as not just racially different but also deviant in terms of gender and sexuality. After establishing the historical context, we will shift our focus to consider how contemporary artists from the Africa diaspora use visual culture and aesthetics to actively challenge and critique overdetermined stereotypes of blackness. Throughout the semester we will study the manner in which class, gender, and sexuality are central to the production of the black body and we will engage with various representations of blackness that consider these intersecting social formations.",Freshman Seminar:Imaging Blackness: Race and Visual Culture in the African Diaspora,M-W----,3,1:00P-2:30P,Ellapen,,1,

TBA,L90 AFAS 3140," The academic study of urban inequality proceeds from the understanding that: 1) cities are deeply unequal, especially when considered in terms of race and class; 2) rather than being random or natural, urban inequality is the product of human ideas, policies, and practices; and 3) urban inequality has substantial and enduring impacts on city life and life chances, especially for racial minorities and the poor. Echoing these general themes, this course closely examines the causes, development, and consequences of urban inequality in the U.S. context. In order to explore U.S. urban inequality most clearly, the course focuses on the African-American urban experience and what has variously been called the ""black belt,"" the inner city, and, most importantly, the ghetto. The scope is still national, though, with analyses of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, D.C., Detroit, Chicago, New Orleans, Oakland, and St. Louis, among other cities. The course primarily draws from sociology and history but also includes insights from anthropology, political science, criminology, and law, among other disciplines.","Urban Inequality: Racism, Segregation, & Ghettoization in the American City",-T-R---,3,10:00A-11:30A,Vieyra,,1,

How might we document and theorize black aesthetics in relationship to black politics? This course considers these questions by examining contemporary art practices that champion black humanity, and intervene in anti-black racism in the criminal justice system, housing, education, employment, and everyday life. We observe black aesthetics in practices such as poetry, performance art, theater, dance, music, photography, film, and visual art. We study foundational and contemporary critical theory invested in black politics, black feminism, black resilience, black excellence, and black joy. We also engage with St. Louis artists, and practice producing artistic work, including a performance or action, a song or poem, and visual artwork or short film. No artistic experience is required.

TBA,L90 AFAS 3600," This course examines major themes in the history of the Caribbean from the fifteenth to the twentieth century. The first half of the course will focus on the fifteenth to the nineteenth century, exploring issues such as indigenous societies, European encounter and conquest, plantation slavery, the resistance of enslaved Africans and emancipation. The remainder of the course focuses on aspects of the cultural, economic, political and social experiences of Caribbean peoples during the twentieth century. Major areas of inquiry include the labor rebellions of the 1930s, decolonization, diasporic alliances, Black Power, identity construction and the politics of tourism. While the English-speaking Caribbean constitutes the main focus, references will be made to other areas such as Cuba and Haiti. Additionally, the Caribbean will be considered in a multilayered way with a view to investigating the local (actors within national boundaries), the regional (historical events that have rendered the region a unit of analysis) and the global (larger globalizing forces such as capitalism, colonialism, migration and slavery that have made the Caribbean central to world history).

TBA,L90 AFAS 3662," Between 1957 and 1975, one African territory after another made the transition from European colony to independent nation state. Widespread optimism that these ""transfers of power"" would bring a new era of prosperity and dignity dissipated quickly as the new nations struggled with political instability, military coups, social unrest, and persistent poverty. Consequently many western observers and development specialists are certain that they have become ""failed states"" requiring foreign assistance to develop properly. This course challenges these assumptions by tracing the origins of African governance and economic development from their imperial origins into the independence era. By exploring nation-building, economic planning, and public administration from the perspective of political elites, foreign experts, and ordinary people the class takes an intimate look at how colonies became nation states. These new perspectives offer students a historical grounding in international public administration and development by exploring how imperial ideas and concepts continue to influence contemporary social planning and development policy in both Africa and the wider world.

However, this simply is not the case. When it comes to politics and political thought, African Americans, and those who make up the Black population in the United States, exhibit a broad range of intra-racial diversity. Manifested along the fault lines of class, gender, age, ideology, and a number of other factors, the complexity of Black political thought is built upon the structure of both African American communities and the larger American political landscape. This course will explore the contours of Black political thought in the United States, while paying close attention to various ideologies, pivotal historical moments and major debates shaping the course of African-American political life.",Black Political Thought,M-W----,3,10:00A-11:30A,Fenderson,,1,

TBA,L98 AMCS 1012," This course provides a survey of the field of Urban Studies, utilizing the city of St. Louis as a field site. The major purpose of the course is to gradually reveal how a city operates internally, and how it operates externally with its sister cities, surrounding metropolitan areas and neighboring states, amidst competing and often contradictory interests. Utilizing historical analysis as a guide, the course will briefly revisit the experiences of previous waves of ethnic groups to the St. Louis metropolitan area, as a lens for understanding the current social, political and economic dilemmas which many urban dwellers in St. Louis now face. The course will reveal to students the intricacies of social welfare issues and policies among high density populations, in St. Louis, that are homogeneous and heterogeneous, at the same time. Visits and discussions with various governmental and nongovernmental agencies, and how such agencies function or dysfunction for various constituencies allow students to ask crucial questions regarding equality of opportunity in a democratic society. Students will also encounter diverse communities and neighborhoods and the intended and unintended consequences of social welfare policies designed to ameliorate urban dilemmas such as poverty and inequality, homelessness, educational underachievement, gentrification, migration and immigration, development, health care, fiscal issues, the informal economy, and issues concerned with crime and social justice, among others. Readings are reinforced and challenged through visits, interactions and observations with broad constituencies and institutions, ranging from city officials to community residents.

This is an urgent question at a historical moment when American society is becoming more diverse and more unequal. Through a sociological lens, this course explores key areas of inequality: social class and poverty, racism and sexism, the crisis in health care, and the perils of globalization. We examine empirical underpinnings of these areas focusing on the intersection of statuses related to race, social class, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality that heighten risk for social and political disadvantages. Our investigation capitalizes on rich sources of multidisciplinary data and methods.

TBA,L98 AMCS 299," This course serves as the introductory course analyzing the forces shaping America's cities and surrounding metropolitan areas. It examines as well strategies for dealing with many of the profound social issues affecting urban/metropolitan America. Emanating from an historical perspective, it examines the ways in which industrialization and deindustrialization shaped Northern American cities and the consequences of deindustrialization on urban citizenry. It further surveys the demographic and spatial transformation of American cities examining the consequences of urban transformation on federal, state and local politics, on society and on her institutions. Similarly, the course focuses on the origin and societal changes and emerging goals of urban development, gentrification and evolving patterns of metropolitanism and the necessity for central city as well as neighborhood reconstruction. The dynamics of racial residential segregation, crime and punishment, issues of academic achievement and under-achievement, the social cleavages of urban marginalized communities, family structure, urban homelessness, urban sprawl, and health care, among others, are viewed from the perspective of social justice by exploring social, political, economic, racial, and ethnic factors that impact on access, equity and care. Various theoretical perspectives and philosophies are introduced that have dominated the discourse on race and urban poverty. A field based component complements the coursework, and is designed to build interest, awareness and skills in preparation for outreach to urban communities.

Historical contextualization and in depth analysis of musical scores and various kinds of audio recordings and audiovisual texts will be at the center of the course. Topics to be considered include: the history of sound recording technologies and formats; the role of electronic mass media structures (radio, film, television, the internet); urbanization, national commercial music centers (New York, Hollywood, Nashville), and the importance of regional sounds in a national context; the formation and transformation of select genres (rock, country, various black musics); legal frameworks relating to music as a commodity (copyright, sampling); the impact of visual media on music dissemination, performance, and meanings; and how recorded media of all kinds have transformed the act of listening.

TBA,L98 AMCS 301T," As with all newly emergent technologies, the early automobile rallied enthusiasts and detractors alike, spurring heated debates about class and labor and the role technology has-and should have-in an industrial society. Much like the factory, automobiles became the locus of political, economic, and social conflict, particularly in urban settings where the competing narratives of progress and degradation were especially evident. In this multidisciplinary course we'll examine such debates up close, and develop a working model for studying the relationship of technology and culture that complicates popular understandings of technological innovation, change, and social impact. Part of our study will focus on the mechanical and engineering principles of the early-era automobile itself by means of 3D image-modeling, engineering schematics, and instruction manuals to develop an understanding of 'how it works.' Another part will focus on reading primary documents like magazines, newspapers, etiquette manuals, print advertisements (available from WUSTL's Modern Graphic History Library) and other popular publications of the late 19th and early 20th centuries to broaden our historical understanding of cultural perceptions of the automobile, of factories, and of technology in general. Grounding these examinations will be scholarly readings in history and history of technology, sociology of technology, philosophy, and cultural study. Students will develop final projects that explore the many ways that the automobile-as a site of contested narratives, cultural values and ideologies-shaped the broader social, political, and civic culture of the urban landscape. NOTE: no experience in auto mechanics or engineering required! This is a humanities-based study of technology, and while past experience studying culture is helpful, this too is not a pre-requisite.",Technology & American Culture: The Devils Wagon: Controversy & Celebration of the Early Automobile,-T-R---,3,8:30A-10:00A,Walsh,,1,

TBA,L98 AMCS 3081," This course examines the concept, history, and culture of American exceptionalism -- the idea that America has been specially chosen, or has a special mission to the world. First, we examine the Puritan sermon that politicians quote when they describe America as a ""city on a hill."" This sermon has been called the ""ur-text"" of American literature, the foundational document of American culture. Learning and drawing from multiple literary methodologies, we will re-investigate what that sermon means and how it came to tell a story about the Puritan origins of American culture -- a thesis our class will reassess with the help of modern critics. In the second part of this class, we broaden our discussion to consider the wider (and newer) meanings of American exceptionalism, theorizing the concept while looking at the way it has been revitalized, redefined and redeployed in recent years. Finally, the course ends with a careful study of American exceptionalism in modern political rhetoric, starting with JFK and proceeding through Reagan to the current day. Our last days will be spent discussing the rhetoric and legacy of American exceptionalism in the speeches of Obama and Trump. In the end, students will gain a firm grasp of the long history and continuing significance of this concept in American culture.",City on a Hill: The Concept and Culture of American Exceptionalism,-T-R---,3,2:30P-4:00P,Van Engen,,1,

Between these two landmark characters lie the two and a half centuries of rich and diverse fiction for girls that will be at the center of this writing-intensive course. After grounding our studies by reading selected works from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, we will concentrate on twentieth-century productions, beginning with the surprisingly progressive serial fiction produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate and others in the early 1900s. (Titles such as The Motor Girls, The Moving Picture Girls, and The Outdoor Girls advertise the series΂ departure from domestic settings.) Throughout our study of both popular and classic texts, we will investigate the social, political and familial roles for girls that the texts imagine.

TBA,L98 AMCS 312W," Starting with Allan Bloom's ""The Closing of the American Mind,"" a book that helped re-ignite the Culture Wars, this course will consider the debates and problems that pervaded American culture during the 1990s. From the end of the Cold War to the sexual scandals that rocked Bill Clinton's presidency, from the emergence of the Internet to the rise of grunge and rap, the 1990s were a time of vast change in American culture. It was period when we, as a nation, reconsidered the legacy of the 1960s, the Reagan revolution, and the end of the Cold War, a time of economic expansion and cultural tension. In our consideration of this period, we will take a multidisciplinary approach when tackling a variety of materials-ranging from literary fiction (Philip Roth's ""The Human Stain,"" Jonathan Franzen's ""The Corrections"") and popular films (Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" and The Cohen brothers' ""The Big Lebowski"") to personal memoir and the music of Nirvana and Public Enemy-in an attempt to come to a better understanding of our recent history. Throughout the semester, we will pursue the vexed cultural, political, and historical questions that Americans faced in the years between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, and consider how literary texts imagined this period of American history. Other possible texts include David Foster Wallace's ""A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,"" Joan Didion's ""Political Fictions,"" Toni Morrison's ""Paradise,"" John Updike's ""Rabbit at Rest,"" and Elizabeth Wurtzel's ""Prozac Nation.""

TBA,L98 AMCS 3132," Most legal practice consists not of fine oratory but rather of great writing. However, it is not only lawyers who need to be able to incorporate the law into their professional practice: in this course, we will look at the many different types of writing in and about the law to see how the principles of rhetoric must be used to persuade in different ways depending on the writer's purpose. We will learn the skills necessary to adapt the framing of our writing to its audience as we think about how we might persuade a judge, a lay client, a community, a committee or other professionals. We will consider the psychological effects of our writing and how we seek to persuade our readers not only with the strength of our reasoning but with the power of our emotional appeal to their particular interests. We will learn how to think and write about the law in a range of circumstances as assignments cover writing for business about implications of laws, reporting about a law for the popular press, investigating a legal issue and explaining a law's ramifications as well as attempting to encourage support for a particular law; this is not, however, a technical legal writing course. Readings will be drawn from statutes and judgments but more commonly from academic, business and popular examples of writing on the interpretation of laws governing topical concerns. Issues to be dealt with may include the extent of police/citizens' rights to protect themselves (so-called Stand Your Ground laws); rights to refuse medical treatment (Cruzan v Director, Missouri Dept of Health); religious groups' rights to discriminate (The Religious Freedom Restoration Act); Open Carry laws (St. Louis Zoo v Smith); immigration proposals such as The Dream Act; reform of mandatory prison sentences.",Topics in Composition: Writing and the Law,M-W----,3,11:30A-1:00P,Thomas,,1,
TBA,L98 AMCS 315A," This course explores what happens when the expressive energy of black-authored genres of American popular music--ragtime, blues, jazz, rock, and rap--spills over into modern and contemporary American literature. Why did ragtime come to symbolize interracial and international mixture in the early 20th-century American novel, and how did jazz--and the slogan of the ""Jazz Age""--grow to signify the national distinctiveness of American modernism? How did rock help to steer the postmodern turn, and why is rap now canonizing itself as an academic poetry through thick anthologies and footnote-heavy artist memoirs? How has American writing's long-running commentary on popular music affected that music's history and mythology--and vice versa? Writers (and writer-musicians) to be studied include James Weldon Johnson, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Langston Hughes, Louis Armstrong, Gwendolyn Bennett, Jack Kerouac, Ralph Ellison, Frank O'Hara, Rita Dove, Bob Dylan, Don DeLillo, Patti Smith, Richard Hell, and Jay-Z.

TBA,L98 AMCS 315B," This course takes morality and the question of ""what's right"" seriously as a lens through which to understand and assess modern American history. ""Morality"" is, of course, a devilishly flexible rhetoric, a language invoked to tell people how to act and how to be good, or, conversely, to criticize and to shame. When the state or a community wants its citizens or members to be ""good,"" it crafts laws and creates customs to encourage or inhibit behaviors. This class examines how state and non-state actors have attempted to regulate the lived experiences of Americans and the conflicts that emerge over what, exactly, is correct, or right, or good for individuals, society, and the state. It interrogates what values the state impresses upon its citizens and what values citizens want the state to uphold.","Virtues, Vices, Values: Regulating Morality in Modern America",-T-----,3,2:30P-5:30P,Griffith,,1,

We must work to lift people who are underserved; we must expand the range of abilities for those who are caught in only one kind of training; and we must each learn to be creative thinkers contributing our abilities to many sectors of our society. In this course, we expand our views about learning by experimenting with the creative process of lateral thinking. In the first six weeks of the semester, we will learn about learning by meeting with exceptional people with many scholarly, professional, and civic engagement accomplishments. We also learn by working in teams to develop an exciting set of 2-D / 3-D, hands-on, problem-solving workshops for middle-schoolers from economically disadvantaged urban families; the workshop curriculum is be based upon your knowledge and passion as well as your interests.

TBA,L98 AMCS 3450," Emerging in American films most forcefully during the 1940s, film noir is a cycle of films associated with a distinctive visual style and a cynical worldview. In this course, we will explore the sexual politics of film noir as a distinctive vision of American sexual relations every bit as identifiable as the form's stylized lighting and circuitous storytelling. We will explore how and why sexual paranoia and perversion seem to animate this genre and why these movies continue to influence ""neo-noir"" filmmaking into the 21st century, even as film noir's representation of gender and sexuality is inseparable from its literary antecedents, most notably, the so-called ""hard-boiled"" school of writing. We will read examples from this literature by Dashiell Hammett, James Cain, Raymond Chandler and Cornell Woolrich, and discuss these novels and short stories in the context of other artistic and cultural influences on gendered power relations and film noir. We will also explore the relationship of these films to censorship and to changing post-World War II cultural values.

TBA,L98 AMCS 3507," Thousands of lawsuits are filed daily in the state and federal courts of the United States. The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding both the conduct and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation ""literacy"" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that ""literacy"" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the duty of landlords to prevent criminal assaults on their tenants, groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police.

This course will examine literary depictions of black athletes-in novels, memoirs, essays, and poems-in order to better understand the cultural significance of sportsmen and women in the African American struggle for equality, from abolitionism to the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement. We will read works by Douglass, Ralph Ellison, Maya Angelou, and John Edgar Wideman, among others, and examine the lives and athletic pursuits of prominent athletes such as Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, Wilma Rudolph, Michael Jordan, and LeBron James.

AB Law Bldg / 404,L98 AMCS 3561," This course (formerly called ""Women and the Law"") explores how social constructions of gender, race, class, and sexuality have shaped traditional legal reasoning and American legal concepts, including women's legal rights. We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context. We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives. For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (or women and men) use the law to gain greater equality? What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality? What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists? How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women.

Key movements organizing the course units include, among others: the Temperance Movement, Abolitionist Movements, the Women's Suffrage Movements, Women's Labor Movements, Women's Global Peace Movements, and Recent Immigration Movements. Readings and discussion will pay particular attention to the movements of women of color, as well as the critiques of women of color of dominant women's movements.

TBA,L98 AMCS 371A," A review of theoretical and empirical research on how and why people migrate across international borders, and the consequences of international migration for immigrants and natives in the United States. While immigration is one of the most controversial issues in the contemporary United States, these contentious debates are not new. Americans once voiced the same concerns about the economic and social impact of Southern and Eastern European immigrants that today are aimed at immigrants from Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. In this course we will compare historical (1880-1920) and contemporary (1965-present) waves of immigration to the United States. We will explore why and how people migrate, immigrant integration, the impact of immigration on native-born Americans, and how government policies-at the national, state, and local level-shape immigrant assimilation and what it means to be considered truly ""American,"" in a social as well as a legal sense.

TBA,L98 AMCS 3742," From the beginning of the human campaign, societies have socialized the spaces and places where they live. This socialization comes in many forms, including the generation of sacred natural places (e.g., Mt. Fuji) to the construction of planned urban settings where culture is writ large in overt and subtle contexts. Over the past two decades or so, anthropologists, archaeologists, and geographers have developed a wide body of research concerning these socially constructed and perceived settings -- commonly known as ""landscapes"". This course takes a tour through time and across the globe to trace the formation of diverse social landscapes, starting in prehistoric times and ending in modern times. We will cover various urban landscapes, rural landscapes, nomadic landscapes (and others) and the intersection of the natural environment, the built environments, and the symbolism that weaves them together. Chronologically, we will range from 3000 BCE to 2009 CE and we will cover all the continents. This course will also trace the intellectual history of the study of landscape as a social phenomenon, and will investigate the current methods used to recover and describe social landscapes around the world and through time.

Social participation can be a challenge for people with disabilities, while resources to address these needs tend to be limited. This course will begin by critically analyzing concepts of disability, Quality of Life, health and social participation. We will construct a framework for examining social participation and community resources across the lifespan. Public health, educational and environmental theories and methods will be applied to programs and services that aim to enhance quality of life with disabilities. We will analyze ecological approaches to enhancing social participation.

TBA,L98 AMCS 375A," In recent months we have learned that the Trump administration plans to re-negotiate NAFTA, extend the wall along the Mexico border, and pass large infrastructure bills. Such protectionist policies are informed by an old idea: that investing in U.S.-made goods is not only stimulating to the economy, but inherently patriotic--that it will ""Make America Great Again."" This seminar will explore the long-standing relationship between material consumption, political activism and identity. How does 'buying American' (or 'local,' or from community-minded businesses such as TOM'S) express a sense of who we are as individuals, as identity-based communities, and as a nation? How has it changed with the advent of social media and the digital marketplace? What will be the fate of the old national-consumerist logic in this, a period of continued economic uncertainty and broad skepticism about the practices of multi-national corporations (not to mention the federal government)? In considering these questions, we will look at historical cases ('See America First!' campaigns of the early 20th century, WWII war bonds, 'White label' activism, civil rights boycotts) as well as more-recent 'buy American' movements, including post-9/11 boosterism and various forms of 'conscientious capitalism.' The priorities for our work will include: 1) developing a fuller historical imagination for claims about the political and social meanings of American consumption, broadly defined; 2) conceptualizing the relationships between specific consumer practices and objects (including the material goods themselves) and broad conceptions of shared identity and meaning; and 3) exploring different theories, methods, and approaches to cultural interpretation that might inform later research. The final assignment will be a proposal for a future multidisciplinary cultural-studies project of students' own imagining that is informed by the work of the course.

TBA,L98 AMCS 416," In 1989, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., cancelled their pending exhibit, Robert Mapplethorp: The Perfect Moment. Opponents of the exhibit rejoiced, arguing the ""obscene"" photography was not art. Advocates defended the work, and its NEA funding, as freedom of expression. Advocates and opponents both could claim their positions represented democracy at work. The Mapplethorpe controversy raises fundamental questions that frame this course: Is democracy good for the arts? Are the arts good for democracy? The partnership between the arts and government is vexed yet strangely collaborative. It promotes creative expression and civic participation despite of - and sometimes, because of - troublesome issues that state support for the arts, or, cultural policy, can generate. This course examines those issues, bringing into view the synergistic partnership between art and state and its significance for a democratic, and a creative, society. We explore numerous case studies from the 20th century that foreground this collaboration and highlight the challenges of cultural policy, for example, propaganda posters, New Deal art programs, NEA projects, and Smithsonian exhibits. These studies raise questions that prompt student to think critically about the relationship between art and democracy: How much agency does an artist have if state sponsored? Should the state be able to censor over art it supports? Does art tend to fragment or promote public accord? This historically grounded course draws on various fields of study to examine the context which state-sponsored art was produced, consumed, and interpreted. Students engage with visual and material culture, media, and archival materials. The seminar culminates in a substantial research project of the student's design; topics may be drawn from the early twentieth century to the present-day.","Topics in AMCS: Musings: Art, Government, & the Dilemmas of Cultural Policy in 20th Century America",-T-R---,3,4:00P-5:30P,Murphy,,1,

At the beginning we will deal with the historical development that lead to the purchase of the Louisiana Territory in 1803, will review the developments of World's Fairs since 1851 and will have a look at the grand dimension of the 1904 World's Fair (connected with the Olympic Games). Of central importance are the Art Exhibits from Germany and Austria with their cultural-political implications. The German Emperor had a hand in selecting the German paintings to be sent to St. Louis, and his opposition against modern movements like Impressionism caused opposition in Germany. Austria was different: In their Art Nouveau Pavilion they included secessionists (Hagenbund). The Wiener Werkstaetten (Vienna's Workshops) attracted a lot of attention. Different from the paintings, German Arts and Crafts represented avant-garde movements. We will visit libraries, archives, and museums in St. Louis that have World's Fair holdings.

Moving from about 1830 to 1925, we will explore the development of a deeply contested discourse of ""national manhood"" in the United States, as it emerges in historically specific circumstances. How does whiteness intersect with related discourses of gender, sexuality, and social class? Beginning with the apocalyptic poetry and prose of Edgar Allan Poe, we will examine terrorized whiteness as an identifying feature of normative masculinity in the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, Henry James, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Do these authors claim the power to resist threats to their individual autonomy? To what extent do they experience masculine self-reliance as a myth? How do they imagine meaningful communities? Addressing these social issues and related aesthetic questions, we will venture, as Whitman says, ""in paths untrodden.""

Second, the course emphasizes the skills related to the exercise of policy analysis. These skills include the crafting of technical documents within the field of public policy (e.g. a policy brief) and the application of scientific methods to the exploration of social problems/governmental actions. Likely issues related to this course feature include the use of scientific knowledge in political arenas, engagement with stakeholders and the intended/unintended consequences of policy science to political decision-making. Third, this course simulates the policymaking context through students' participation in mock congressional testimonies. These focal areas will become central to an understanding of four social concerns: school desegregation following the Brown decisions; affirmative action in higher education; Head Start programs and/or the ESEA Act of 1965, also known as No Child Left Behind. Educational opportunity, achievement inequality and social change will be the primary interests that link these course features.",Education and Public Policy in the United States,--W----,3,2:30P-5:30P,Odis Johnson,,1,

What is at stake in these debates? Are we seeking to promote basic humanity, racial and gender equality or utopian visions of rehabilitation? This course seeks to historically contextualize prison reform and abolitionism from the 13th Amendment's re-articulation of slavery to current resistance to mass incarceration.

Over the past two decades or so, anthropologists, archaeologists, and geographers have developed a wide body of research concerning these socially constructed and perceived settings -- commonly known as ""landscapes"". This course takes a tour through time and across the globe to trace the formation of diverse social landscapes, starting in prehistoric times and ending in modern times. We will cover various urban landscapes, rural landscapes, nomadic landscapes (and others) and the intersection of the natural environment, the built environments, and the symbolism that weaves them together. Chronologically, we will range from 3000 BCE to 2009 CE and we will cover all the continents.

These resources are inextricably linked not only to the most common and necessary of our day-to-day activities, but impact each other in profound ways. Until recently, the study of these resources was fragmented in separate sectors, ultimately leading to lack of institutional coordination, infrastructural lock-in and incomplete modeling systems. These incomplete systems overlook the complex overlaps of natural systems and render sustainability planning more tenuous than it could be. In response, these core resources are being studied together as a ""nexus"" to enhance synergies and prevent trade-offs across sectors. However, this nexus further requires astute attention to the all too ""human"" questions of resource use, waste and justice. If water, energy and food security are to be simultaneously achieved, social scientists must be at the forefront, contributing holistic research that brings the human back into socio-natural systems.",Being Human: The Food-Energy-Ecosytem-Water Nexus,--W----,3,12:00P-3:00P,O'Leary,,1,

McMillan / G058,L48 Anthro 4597," The study of human remains in archaeological contexts offers us a rich perspective on human life and society in the past. Our bodies are shaped by genetics, environmental factors, subsistence, disease, and physical activities over the life course. At the same time, social organization, inequality, and ideologies also shape the human experience; they often become reflected in the built environments of tombs and cemeteries, the grave offerings, and interment styles that surround human remains in archaeological contexts. This course offers an introduction to bioarchaeology and mortuary archaeology as complementary approaches to the study of life in the past. The goal of the course is to understand how activities, norms and beliefs, and environments shaped bodies in life and death, and the different ways in which archaeologists can gain insight into the past through the study of human remains and burials. Course lectures and discussions focus on recent advances in research and ongoing debates in the two fields with examples from prehistory and history around the world, from North and South America, to Europe, Asia and Africa.

Fuji) to the construction of planned urban settings where culture is writ large in overt and subtle contexts. Over the past two decades or so, anthropologists, archaeologists, and geographers have developed a wide body of research concerning these socially constructed and perceived settings -- commonly known as ""landscapes"". This course takes a tour through time and across the globe to trace the formation of diverse social landscapes, starting in prehistoric times and ending in modern times. We will cover various urban landscapes, rural landscapes, nomadic landscapes (and others) and the intersection of the natural environment, the built environments, and the symbolism that weaves them together. Chronologically, we will range from 3000 BCE to 2009 CE and we will cover all the continents. This course will also trace the intellectual history of the study of landscape as a social phenomenon, and will investigate the current methods used to recover and describe social landscapes around the world and through time. Join in situating your own social map alongside the most famous and the most obscure landscapes of the world and trace the global currents of your social landscape!",Social Landscapes in Global View,-T-R---,3,2:30P-4:00P,Frachetti,,1,

TBA,L49 ARAB 4001," This seminar will provide an opportunity to explore in some depth various facets of the convivencia (coexistence) of Muslims, Jews, and Christians in medieval Iberia. We will pick up the timeline with the emergence of an Ibero-Islamic society in the 8th century CE; the seminar's historical horizon stretches up to the turn of the 16th century, when Spanish Jews and Muslims were equally faced with the choice between exile and conversion to Christianity. Until about 1100, Muslims dominated most of the Iberian Peninsula; from then onward, Christians ruled much and eventually all of Spain and Portugal. Through a process termed, from a Christian perspective, as reconquista (Reconquest), Catholic kingdoms acquired large Muslim enclaves. As borders moved, Jewish communities found themselves under varying Muslim or Christian dominion, or migrated from one realm to the other. Interactions between the three ethno-religious communities occurred throughout, some characterized by mutual respect and shared creativity and others by rivalry and strife. The course focuses on these religious and cultural encounters, placing them in various historical and geographic contexts. It will raise questions concerning the ambiguities of religious change, and the interplay of persecution and toleration. Methodologically, the seminar emphasizes the study of primary sources, including documentary, historiographical, literary and poetical texts. Structurally, the course divides into four main parts. Part 1 will cover the political and cultural history of Iberia from the 8th to the early 16th centuries; part 2 will be devoted to the Jewish experience under Muslim rule; and part 3 to the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Christian Spain. In part 4, we will discuss primary sources originating from each of the three communities that are portraying the respective Other. All sources will be read in English translation; however, students are encouraged to make use of their linguistic and cultural expertise acquired in previous classes. This is the capstone seminar for Jewish, Islamic, & Near Eastern Studies majors, Arabic majors, and Hebrew majors.

Kemper / 211,L01 Art-Arch 4629," Michelangelo Merisi (Michael Angelo Merigi or Amerighi) da Caravaggio (29 September 1571 - 18 July 1610) was one of the most important and influential painters of the Seventeenth Century, in Italy and throughout Europe. He was active in Rome, Naples, Malta, and Sicily between ~1592 and 1610. But who was Caravaggio? What do we really know about his tempestuous life, and how it factors in the art he created? Caravaggio was a powerful, brilliant, brutish, and hugely influential artist; a belligerent personality, brawler, and murderer. He was a man of contradictions: a devout Christian and bi-sexual sodomite; a Knight of Malta and a fugitive from the law.

But modern art and modern war are qualitatively different from their counterparts in the past in ways that ensured that their relationship would become more problematic and oppositional. The challenge of finding new artistic languages to express the new conditions of mechanized combat led many artists to explore abstraction, fragmentation, absurdity or arbitrariness to convey the energy, impersonality and nihilism of modern war. When the British soldier and poet Wilfred Owen (1893-1918) wrote of the human devastation of World War I as ""obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud,"" he strained for metaphoric language appropriate to its magnitude.

Lab Sciences / 201,L07 Chem 542," Renewable sources of energy and hybrid vehicles have gained popularity due to the rising environmental crisis caused by the emission of greenhouse gases. Lucky for humans, both wind and solar energy can be captured, stored, and reused at a later time in order to power vehicles, portable electronics, and homes via electrochemical energy storage technologies. Furthermore, energy storage devices possessing extended cyclability capable of instantaneously delivering bursts of electricity, and featuring a high-power energy density, are ideal candidates for controlling interruptions in the transmission of electricity in grids. Not surprisingly, this field of study is very important to society and is the focus of research for a large and vibrant scientific community spanning globally across national laboratories, universities, and private industries. A key component that enables the development of state-of-the-art devices is the synthesis and application of nanostructured materials such as carbon allotropes, metal oxides, and conducting polymers. These nanostructured materials afford enhanced properties such as surface area, directional transport, and conductivity for increasing the efficiency of energy storage. This course will provide an introduction to current synthetic protocols and applications of nanostructured organic, inorganic, and composite materials typically utilized for storing energy. We will focus on the structure and property relationships that are desired for attaining state-of-the-art performance in both pseudocapacitive and capacitive materials.

Whether in North Africa with the Arab Spring, in West Africa with university strikes, or in East Africa through a linguistic full bloom, youth have been shaping social responses to societies for a long period. In this course, we will study social structures, including churches, NGOs, developmental agencies as well as learn about examples of Muslim youth movements, and the global civil society. The course will also explore how youth impact cultural movements in Africa and how they influence the world. In particular, we will examine Hip-Hop movements, sports, and global youth culture developments that center on fashion, dress, dance, and new technologies.

McMillan / 219,L66 ChSt 316F," It is said that at this time in history the entire country must make a commitment to improve the positive possibilities of education. We must work to lift people who are underserved; we must expand the range of abilities for those who are caught in only one kind of training; and we must each learn to be creative thinkers contributing our abilities to many sectors of our society. In this course, we expand our views about learning by experimenting with the creative process of lateral thinking. In the first six weeks of the semester, we will learn about learning by meeting with exceptional people with many scholarly, professional, and civic engagement accomplishments. We also learn by working in teams to develop an exciting set of 2-D / 3-D, hands-on, problem-solving workshops for middle-schoolers from economically disadvantaged urban families; the workshop curriculum is be based upon your knowledge and passion as well as your interests. During the last eight weeks, we deliver these workshops once a week to students at Compton-Drew Middle School (adjacent to the Science Center in the city of St. Louis). In this course we celebrate the choices of studies we each pursue, and expand our experience by learning from each other's knowledge bases and creativity.

Beginning with reform-minded Confucian scholars around the turn of the century, modern Chinese literature and culture has had an overriding concern with the fate of China itself. As a result, close readings of literature, popular culture, and criticism from the late Qing Dynasty to the Cultural Revolution give us insight into many of the fundamental issues facing the Chinese people through decades of revolution, foreign invasion, civil war, and modernization. During the first half of the century, Chinese literature and culture saw the great achievements of canonical modern writers, such as Lu Xun, Shen Congwen, and Ding Ling. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, a singular revolutionary culture ensued, in which literature and the arts were put in the service of political consciousness-molding and Cultural Revolution.

Despite the distinct genres, time periods, and topics, one important aspect will regularly appear: apparently people perceived the boundaries between the living and the dead to be quite porous in pre-modern China.

TBA,L04 Chinese 482," Although women of premodern China have often been portrayed as little more than long-suffering victims of male patriarchy and sexual repression, their lives were far more complicated, diverse, and interesting. Women played roles as filial daughters, dutiful wives, and devoted mothers, but also as proud courtesans, clever entrepreneurs, educated scholars and teachers, independent nuns, fierce warriors and even powerful rulers. In this course we will begin with a broad overview of the ideal traditional roles for women established in early China. We will then move on to a general exploration of some of the ways women were represented in classical literature by male writers. Our main focus, however, will be on how, over time, more and more women took up the brush and began to write themselves. In so doing they were able to express their own subjectivity and often radically reinscribe many of the notions of femininity and of female roles that were dominant during their times. We will conclude with a discussion of ways in which traditional women writers both anticipated and contributed to the 20th century transition to modernity. Most of our class discussion will be based on primary sources in English translation, supplemented by occasional secondary critical scholarly articles where relevant.

Kemper / 211,L08 Classics 428," The scholarly field of Image or Visual Studies has developed in response to the widespread proliferation of images, both still and moving, in contemporary life. It distinguishes itself from traditional art history by examining visual representations of all types, not only works of high art, and by concentrating on the role those representations play in the formation of culture. Though most of the scholarship produced in this field focuses on the modern world, it depends upon ideas first developed in Mediterranean antiquity. This course has two primary goals. We will conduct an historical examination of practices and theories of image making from Near Eastern antiquity to modernity. In so doing, we will also carry out an historiographical survey of the major works in Image/Visual Studies, thereby gaining an appreciation for the wide range of methods of inquiry employed in this important field of research. Prerequisites: Intro to Western Art (L01 113) or Intro to Modern Art (L01 215); one 300-level course in Art History preferred; or permission of instructor.",The Invention of the Image: From Classical Art History to Modern Visual Studies,M------,3,3:00P-6:00P,Jones,,1,
TBA,L08 Classics 4763," The home of both Alexander the Great and Aristotle, Macedon was pivotal to the course of ancient Greek and Roman history and yet stood apart as a culturally and politically distinct region. Macedonian dynasts dominated the Hellenistic world and deeply shaped Roman reception of Greek culture, while others profoundly affected the intellectual life of antiquity. We will explore topics ranging from ethnicity, religion, and the nature of kingship to urbanization and Macedon's emergence as a great power until its subsequent transformation at the hands of the conquering Romans. We will pay special attention to Macedon's neighbors, especially Thrace and Illyria, as well as to Macedon's relationships with the Persian Empire and the Greek coastal colonies.

We'll read a variety of texts: plays and poems, satires and novels-literature of the early modern world (Shakespeare and Milton); Augustan satire (Dryden and Swift), high canonical modernists (Eliot and Yeats); and modern fiction (Nadine Gordimer and John Coetzee). We shall ask of all these texts how political force seems to be at work in literature that we often regard as elevated loftily above partisanship, and how literature has been and continues to be used to justify-to dignify-programs and regimes and cultural agendas that can seem to deny values we might hold close. Readings will include, among other texts, Shakespeare's ""Merchant of Venice"" Milton's ""Areopagitica,"" Jonathan Swift's ""Modest Proposal,"" Yeats's "" Second Coming,"" Eliot's ""Wasteland,"" Nadine Gordimer's ""The Pick-Up,"" and John Coetzee's ""Disgrace"" and ""Elizabeth Costello.""

Of central importance are the Art Exhibits from Germany and Austria with their cultural-political implications. The German Emperor had a hand in selecting the German paintings to be sent to St. Louis, and his opposition against modern movements like Impressionism caused opposition in Germany. Austria was different: In their Art Nouveau Pavilion they included secessionists (Hagenbund). The Wiener Werkstaetten (Vienna's Workshops) attracted a lot of attention. Different from the paintings, German Arts and Crafts represented avant-garde movements. We will visit libraries, archives, and museums in St. Louis that have World's Fair holdings.

The text itself is complex and layered, responding to its literary precursors, Enlightenment science, radical politics, aesthetic theory, feminism, Romantic idealism, Gothic horror, and more. In order to understand these influences, we will examine texts read by Mary Shelley (and her characters), including letters, essays, poems, and scientific reports. Our study of the novel's afterlives will begin with R. B. Peake's 1823 play, Presumption, which shaped much of the popular understanding of the Frankenstein myth during the 19th century. Our investigation of 20th- and 21st-century manifestations of Frankenstein will focus on its appearance in film, racial discourse, scientific ethics, popular culture, and advertising. This portion of the course will include a viewing of the iconic 1931 Boris Karloff film, which established indelible versions of the mad scientist and his ""monster.""

The course will include 1) readings on networks from philosophy and cultural criticism; 2) a consideration of origins and aims of network analysis as emerged in the sociology of the twentieth century; 3) a practical introduction to the methods of network analysis as it is currently used in the social sciences and humanities; and 4) a review of some recent network-analytical scholarship in the humanities, on topics ranging from correspondence networks and networks of literary characters to network approaches to modeling intellectual influence and the dissemination of ideas. We will meet twice weekly, once for a two-hour discussion and once for a one-hour, hands-on lab where students will learn to analyze networks using software packages such as Gephi and UCINET.

TBA,L16 Comp Lit 493," The Great War of 1914-1918 is one of the most momentous events in history. We can approach its broad European import by reading its literatures comparatively. Far wider than the concerns of any one national ideology, the literature of record represents a profound crisis in the European cultural imaginary. A number of critical and interpretive issues will be in play in our readings, which will move through three major phases. We begin with the powerful immediacy of trench poetry (1914-1919), develop into the constructed narratives of the great postwar novels and memoirs (1920-1931), and then turn toward the retrospect of the 1930s, which is also the prospect on the next, now inevitable, war. The authors featured include combatant and civilian writers, names well-known and not so famous: Mann, Apollinaire, Owen, Pound, Cocteau, H.D., Woolf, Maurois, West, Celine, Joyce, Musil, Eliot, Rosenberg, Sassoon, Graves, Hardy, Trakl, Stramm, Lichtenstein, Pguy, Barbusse, Manning, J_nger, Zweig, Brittain, and Kroner.

This graduate-level course will investigate artistic mediations of the Holocaust, focusing in particular on questions of ethics, aesthetics and history and concentrating on two objectives. First, we will examine the various debates and controversies surrounding the issue of artistic representation of the Holocaust and discuss some of the theoretical and philosophical texts that have formed the core of Holocaust Studies by critics such as James Young, Dominick LaCapra, Marianne Hirsch, Sidra Ezrahi, and Geoffrey Hartman. Second, we will explore the ways in which literature and film, both fictional and documentary/testimonial, have attempted to narrate the events of the Holocaust. We will examine exemplary responses to the Shoah in a variety of genres by writers and filmmakers such as Primo Levi, Jean Amry, Jurek Becker, Aaron Appelfeld, Liana Millu, David Grossman, Edgar Hilsenrath, Art Spiegelman, Claude Lanzmann and Alain Resnais. Central to our exploration of these texts will be issues of representation, the role of memory, the problems and limits of language, questions of trauma, the phenomena of postmemory and multidirectional memory, and the notion that a ""master narrative"" of the Holocaust has emerged in public discourse. Designed for graduate and advanced undergraduate students; undergraduate enrollment only with express permission of instructor.

TBA,L29 Dance 331," This course introduces students to various approaches to studying dance in a humanities context. We will explore how people create meaning through dance and how dance, in turn, influences social norms, political institutions, aesthetic ideals and cultural practices. As we compare dance forms across the globe, we will also examine issues of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity, analyzing how dance literally embodies identity. At the same time, we will discover how contemporary unequal power hierarchies bear on our designation of some dance forms as ""Western"" and others as ""world"" or ""ethnic."" Tensions around assessment of authenticity/creativity, adaptation/appropriation, agency/resistance, and cultural hierarchies such as vernacular/modern, shift with social and political hegemony and with the individual's position as insider or outsider relative to ethnic self-identification and traditional forms of expression. The first part of the course introduces the student to different methodological approaches to studying dance. Throughout the semester, the usual process of the course will be discussion of assigned reading and viewing and analyzing together dance videos shown in class.

Part of these terrors, the course asserts, happened and is happening in the realm of the affective, ephemeral, and archival. Moving across theoretical works, literature, and theater, our readings differently query: how can performance enable us to recuperate the lives of those violently erased from the archive? How to imagine embodiment for subjects ""tracked"" by history, such as black folks whose bodies suggest other forms of pathology, like sexual deviancy, mentally ""insanity,"" and other forms of criminalization? How have attachments to ghosts been used as a methodology to stage and reperform blackness in the past and in the present? And lastly, how can we capture embodiment (or enfleshment) without live bodies? By rethinking ""liveness,"" ""absence,"" ""loss,"" and ""remains,"" the readings and discussions will offer performance as a methodological and analytical infrastructure to conduct historical and/or archival research.","Performing Ghosts: Blackness, Performance, and Archival Erasure",--W----,3,3:00P-6:00P,Rhaisa Williams,,1,

Rudolph / 333,L19 EPSc 566," The development of non-traditional isotope geochemistry in the past decade has greatly expanded our understanding of many facets of Earth and planetary sciences. Over 1000 papers have been published using non-traditional isotopes to study the origin of the solar system, the formation of planetary bodies, the differentiation of mantle and core, the evolution of the crust, the changes of paleo-climate, the global geochemical cycle of elements, and the genesis of natural resources. This course will survey these new isotope systems in either high-temperature igneous differentiation or low-temperature environments. It aims to help students understand the wide applications of these new isotopes in tracing chemical, biological and physical processes. The course is divided into three parts. Part I will first introduce the principles and theories of non-traditional isotopic fractionation and then it will review analytical methods that are primarily used for non-traditional isotopes such as MC-ICP-MS, TIMS and SIMS. Part II will dive into individual isotopic systems (Li, Mg, Si, Cl, Ca, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ge, Se, Mo, Hg, Tl and U stable isotopes) and it will focus on one or two of their main applications. Part III will be carried out in the instructor's lab for the last three weeks of the class. The instructor and the students will decide together on the one topic of the final project carried out all class members.

TBA,L03 East Asia 352," This undergraduate course surveys the major writers and works of 20th century Korean literature. During the 20th century Korea went through a radical process of modernization. From its colonization by Japan, to its suffering of a civil war within the cold war order, to its growth into a cultural and economic powerhouse, Korea's historical experience is at once unique and typical of that of a third-world nation. By immersing ourselves in the most distinctive literary voices from Korea, we examine how the Korean experience of modernization was filtered through its cultutral production. In class discussion, we pay special attention to the writers' construction of the self and the nation. How do social categories such as ethnicity, class, gender, and race figure in the varying images of the self? And how do these images relate to the literary vision of the nation? Along the way, we observe the prominent ideas, themes, and genres of Korean literature. This class combines discussion with lecture with students strongly encouraged to participate. All literary texts are in English translation and no previous knowledge of Korean is required.",Literature of Modern and Contemporary Korea,M-W----,3,2:30P-4:00P,Lee,,1,
TBA,L03 East Asia 3750," This course is an introduction to modern China through literature, critical thought, and analysis during of the first half of the twentieth century. In this semester we read the important examples of fiction, essays, and criticism, against their historical and cultural background. Beginning with reform-minded Confucian scholars around the turn of the century, modern Chinese literature and culture has had an overriding concern with the fate of China itself. As a result, close readings of literature, popular culture, and criticism from the late Qing Dynasty to the Cultural Revolution give us insight into many of the fundamental issues facing the Chinese people through decades of revolution, foreign invasion, civil war, and modernization. During the first half of the century, Chinese literature and culture saw the great achievements of canonical modern writers, such as Lu Xun, Shen Congwen, and Ding Ling. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, a singular revolutionary culture ensued, in which literature and the arts were put in the service of political consciousness-molding and Cultural Revolution. During this time, an alternative Chinese literary culture developed in Taiwan, resulting in work that featured various strains of modernism and its resistance.

In particular, we will observe how various religious texts, short stories, and plays from China's earliest times until the sixteenth century depicted the interactions of the living and the dead. Despite the distinct genres, time periods, and topics, one important aspect will regularly appear: apparently people perceived the boundaries between the living and the dead to be quite porous in pre-modern China. In other words, the dead seemed to have played as much of a role in society and everyday life as living family members, friends, and government officials.","Of Zombies, Ghosts, and Ancestors: Interactions of the Living and the Dead in Chinese Religions",M-W----,3,4:00P-5:30P,Zuern,,1,

This course provides an introduction to those iconoclastic filmmakers, who went on to break with major studios and revolutionize oppositional filmmaking in Japan. We will analyze the challenging politics and aesthetics of these confrontational films for what they tell us about Japan's modern history and cinema. The films provoke as well as entertain, providing trenchant (sometimes absurd) commentaries on postwar Japanese society and its transformations. Themes include: the legacy of WWII and Japanese imperialism; the student movement; juvenile delinquency; sexual liberation; and Tokyo subcultures.

TBA,L03 East Asia 482," Although women of premodern China have often been portrayed as little more than long-suffering victims of male patriarchy and sexual repression, their lives were far more complicated, diverse, and interesting. Women played roles as filial daughters, dutiful wives, and devoted mothers, but also as proud courtesans, clever entrepreneurs, educated scholars and teachers, independent nuns, fierce warriors and even powerful rulers. In this course we will begin with a broad overview of the ideal traditional roles for women established in early China. We will then move on to a general exploration of some of the ways women were represented in classical literature by male writers. Our main focus, however, will be on how, over time, more and more women took up the brush and began to write themselves. In so doing they were able to express their own subjectivity and often radically reinscribe many of the notions of femininity and of female roles that were dominant during their times. We will conclude with a discussion of ways in which traditional women writers both anticipated and contributed to the 20th century transition to modernity. Most of our class discussion will be based on primary sources in English translation, supplemented by occasional secondary critical scholarly articles where relevant.

We shall ask of all these texts how political force seems to be at work in literature that we often regard as elevated loftily above partisanship, and how literature has been and continues to be used to justify-to dignify-programs and regimes and cultural agendas that can seem to deny values we might hold close. Readings will include, among other texts, Shakespeare's ""Merchant of Venice"" Milton's ""Areopagitica,"" Jonathan Swift's ""Modest Proposal,"" Yeats's "" Second Coming,"" Eliot's ""Wasteland,"" Nadine Gordimer's ""The Pick-Up,"" and John Coetzee's ""Disgrace"" and ""Elizabeth Costello.""

But is friendship a possession we can ""have,"" or is it something we do, make, or otherwise work toward? This course explores the literary history of friendship from Montaigne to Milne and beyond. What does it mean to call someone a friend? What is the relationship between friendship and kinship, friendship and desire, friendship and community? And what might happen if we, like Foucault, begin to imagine the socio-political possibilities of friendship ""as a way of life""? As we read a wide range of literary and theoretical writings about friendship, we will experience the transformation in composition, peer review, and revision when we ask ourselves to think about these practices as intellectual work undertaken by--and for--friends, rather than acquaintances, competitors, or strangers. Primary texts may include fiction by Andr Aciman, Junot D_az, Sheila Heti, Kazuo Ishiguro, and Zadie Smith.

This course is designed for non-English majors as well as potential English majors. As we read some of the best, most influential, and most controversial writers of the last hundred years, we'll discuss not just the competing claims about religion and spirituality, but also the functions, forms, and multiple ways of interpreting literature. Studying the topic of religion and spirituality, this class will thus also serve as introduction to the discipline of English and literary studies.

We will explore, among other things, the eruption of the novel, the secularization of autobiography, the literary discovery of the city, the rise of literary and aesthetic criticism that takes literature and art seriously as political and social institutions. In addition to literary works, the course will engage with two or three important models of critical practice e.g. Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Women, Marx's German Ideology, Freud's, The Interpretation of Dreams, T.S.

First, we examine the Puritan sermon that politicians quote when they describe America as a ""city on a hill."" This sermon has been called the ""ur-text"" of American literature, the foundational document of American culture. Learning and drawing from multiple literary methodologies, we will re-investigate what that sermon means and how it came to tell a story about the Puritan origins of American culture -- a thesis our class will reassess with the help of modern critics. In the second part of this class, we broaden our discussion to consider the wider (and newer) meanings of American exceptionalism, theorizing the concept while looking at the way it has been revitalized, redefined and redeployed in recent years. Finally, the course ends with a careful study of American exceptionalism in modern political rhetoric, starting with JFK and proceeding through Reagan to the current day. Our last days will be spent discussing the rhetoric and legacy of American exceptionalism in the speeches of Obama and Trump.

TBA,L14 E Lit 312W," Starting with Allan Bloom's ""The Closing of the American Mind,"" a book that helped re-ignite the Culture Wars, this course will consider the debates and problems that pervaded American culture during the 1990s. From the end of the Cold War to the sexual scandals that rocked Bill Clinton's presidency, from the emergence of the Internet to the rise of grunge and rap, the 1990s were a time of vast change in American culture. It was period when we, as a nation, reconsidered the legacy of the 1960s, the Reagan revolution, and the end of the Cold War, a time of economic expansion and cultural tension. In our consideration of this period, we will take a multidisciplinary approach when tackling a variety of materials-ranging from literary fiction (Philip Roth's ""The Human Stain,"" Jonathan Franzen's ""The Corrections"") and popular films (Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" and The Cohen brothers' ""The Big Lebowski"") to personal memoir and the music of Nirvana and Public Enemy-in an attempt to come to a better understanding of our recent history. Throughout the semester, we will pursue the vexed cultural, political, and historical questions that Americans faced in the years between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, and consider how literary texts imagined this period of American history. Other possible texts include David Foster Wallace's ""A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,"" Joan Didion's ""Political Fictions,"" Toni Morrison's ""Paradise,"" John Updike's ""Rabbit at Rest,"" and Elizabeth Wurtzel's ""Prozac Nation.""

TBA,L14 E Lit 315," This course explores what happens when the expressive energy of black-authored genres of American popular music--ragtime, blues, jazz, rock, and rap--spills over into modern and contemporary American literature. Why did ragtime come to symbolize interracial and international mixture in the early 20th-century American novel, and how did jazz--and the slogan of the ""Jazz Age""--grow to signify the national distinctiveness of American modernism? How did rock help to steer the postmodern turn, and why is rap now canonizing itself as an academic poetry through thick anthologies and footnote-heavy artist memoirs? How has American writing's long-running commentary on popular music affected that music's history and mythology--and vice versa? Writers (and writer-musicians) to be studied include James Weldon Johnson, F.

In the past decade, however, modernism-in-the-singular has been replaced by plural modernisms: Victorian modernism, twenty-first-century modernism, bad modernisms, Jamesian modernism, and the like. We will begin with a recent study by Sean Latham and Gayle Rogers, Modernism: Evolution of an Idea (2015), and read excerpts from criticism by Riding and Graves, Wilson, Kenner, Berman, Walkowitz and Mao, Feldman, Perloff, Latour, Meyer, and Miller together with exemplary modernist poetry and short fiction.

Between these two landmark characters lie the two and a half centuries of rich and diverse fiction for girls that will be at the center of this writing-intensive course. After grounding our studies by reading selected works from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, we will concentrate on twentieth-century productions, beginning with the surprisingly progressive serial fiction produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate and others in the early 1900s. (Titles such as The Motor Girls, The Moving Picture Girls, and The Outdoor Girls advertise the series΂ departure from domestic settings.) Throughout our study of both popular and classic texts, we will investigate the social, political and familial roles for girls that the texts imagine.

TBA,L14 E Lit 3451," Emerging in American films most forcefully during the 1940s, film noir is a cycle of films associated with a distinctive visual style and a cynical worldview. In this course, we will explore the sexual politics of film noir as a distinctive vision of American sexual relations every bit as identifiable as the form's stylized lighting and circuitous storytelling. We will explore how and why sexual paranoia and perversion seem to animate this genre and why these movies continue to influence ""neo-noir"" filmmaking into the 21st century, even as film noir's representation of gender and sexuality is inseparable from its literary antecedents, most notably, the so-called ""hard-boiled"" school of writing. We will read examples from this literature by Dashiell Hammett, James Cain, Raymond Chandler and Cornell Woolrich, and discuss these novels and short stories in the context of other artistic and cultural influences on gendered power relations and film noir. We will also explore the relationship of these films to censorship and to changing post-World War II cultural values. Films to be screened in complete prints or in excerpts will likely include many of the following: The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, Murder My Sweet, Phantom Lady, Strangers on a Train, The Big Sleep, The Killers, Mildred Pierce, The High Wall, Sudden Fear, The Big Combo, Laura, The Glass Key, The Big Heat, Kiss Me Deadly, The Crimson Kimono, Touch of Evil, Alphaville, Chinatown, Taxi Driver, Devil in a Blue Dress, The Bad Lieutenant, and Memento.

In addition to Whitman (1855-1892) and Dickinson (1830-1886), major stops along the way will include Robert Frost (1874-1963), Marianne Moore (1887-1972), and Langston Hughes (1902-1967). Although these are diverse creative voices, we will be reflecting on their common writerly concerns. The course, then, will study poetry in its biographical and cultural context from the American Renaissance of the 1850s to the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and beyond.

In order to understand these influences, we will examine texts read by Mary Shelley (and her characters), including letters, essays, poems, and scientific reports. Our study of the novel's afterlives will begin with R. B. Peake's 1823 play, Presumption, which shaped much of the popular understanding of the Frankenstein myth during the 19th century. Our investigation of 20th- and 21st-century manifestations of Frankenstein will focus on its appearance in film, racial discourse, scientific ethics, popular culture, and advertising.

The goal of the Handbook is to review the recent history of feminist theory's major concepts (body, gender, intersectionality, writing, etc), in order to discuss where feminist theory is going next. The concept we will focus on is ""affect."" The research lab will explore feminist theory's rewriting of the equation of woman with the body in the grip of its passions, its critique of the reason/emotion antinomy, and its advocacy of various modes of knowing through emotion (Jaggar). We will consider projects as diverse as the critique of happiness (Ahmed), love (Kipnis) or optimism (Berlant); the re-valuing of anger (hooks) or grief (Butler); or the recuperation of envy (Ngai). We will trace the imbrication of emotion and capitalism (Hochschilds); the relation between affective labor and ""women's work"" in post-Fordism (Weeks), the racialization of emotion (Ahmed) and its globalization through the care industry (Sassen). The main assignment for the course will be to write a 6,000 words essay titled ""Affect in Feminist Theory.""

TBA,L14 E Lit 4930," The Great War of 1914-1918 is one of the most momentous events in history. We can approach its broad European import by reading its literatures comparatively. Far wider than the concerns of any one national ideology, the literature of record represents a profound crisis in the European cultural imaginary. A number of critical and interpretive issues will be in play in our readings, which will move through three major phases. We begin with the powerful immediacy of trench poetry (1914-1919), develop into the constructed narratives of the great postwar novels and memoirs (1920-1931), and then turn toward the retrospect of the 1930s, which is also the prospect on the next, now inevitable, war. The authors featured include combatant and civilian writers, names well-known and not so famous: Mann, Apollinaire, Owen, Pound, Cocteau, H.D., Woolf, Maurois, West, Celine, Joyce, Musil, Eliot, Rosenberg, Sassoon, Graves, Hardy, Trakl, Stramm, Lichtenstein, Pguy, Barbusse, Manning, J_nger, Zweig, Brittain, and Kroner.

TBA,L14 E Lit 508," American literary study has not shouted from the rooftops about authoritarianism. In the U.S. context, largely resistant to the fascist temptation of the 1930s, Orwellian and other anti-totalitarian allegories have been for high schoolers; Hitler, Mussolini, and company enter as distant topics only in discussions of the Pound Era, the Frankfurt School, and some Foucauldian biopolitics; and the assumed enemy of most varieties of radical interpretation has been the naive liberal rather than the Stalinist apparatchik or Nazi collaborator. Despite the relative indifference of academic criticism, however, a significant vein of 20th- and 21st-century American writing indeed grapples with authoritarianism's causes and consequences and imagines what might unfold if it found a foothold here. This seminar aims to introduce students to three main lines in this vein: historical narratives from Richard Hofstadter's classic essay ""The Paranoid Style in American Politics"" (1964) to Nancy Isenberg's Trumpsplaining book ""White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America"" (2016); theoretical accounts from Hannah Arendt's first American publication, ""The Origins of Totalitarianism"" (1951), to Vaughn Rasberry's ""Race and the Totalitarian Century"" (2016); and creative dystopian fictions from Sinclair Lewis's ""It Can't Happen Here"" (1935)--the inspiration for the class title--to Gary Shteyngart's tragically hilarious ""Super Sad True Love Story"" (2010). These readings will help us tackle a number of pressing questions about responsible literary study, not to mention informed citizenship, after November 2016. What will become of canons and syllabi of American exceptionalism--of the left as well as of the right--amid an international wave of reactionary neo-nationalism? What does the unexpected emergence of an influential, explicitly anti-intellectual alt-right in the U.S. mean for the willfully progressive projects of feminist criticism, disability studies, critical race studies, and queer theory?

Engineering and Arts & Sciences students participate in interdisciplinary teams with law students, handling environmental projects for public interest, environmental or community organizations or individuals. Students from other schools may also participate with permission of instructors. Projects may involve the following activities: representing clients in federal and state court litigation and administrative proceedings; drafting proposed legislation; commenting on proposed regulations, permits, environmental impact statements or environmental assessments, and similar documents; and evaluating matters for potential future action. The goal is that for each project, students will have primary responsibility for handling the matter, and faculty will play a secondary, supervisory role.

TBA,L79 EuSt 4936," The Great War of 1914-1918 is one of the most momentous events in history. We can approach its broad European import by reading its literatures comparatively. Far wider than the concerns of any one national ideology, the literature of record represents a profound crisis in the European cultural imaginary. A number of critical and interpretive issues will be in play in our readings, which will move through three major phases. We begin with the powerful immediacy of trench poetry (1914-1919), develop into the constructed narratives of the great postwar novels and memoirs (1920-1931), and then turn toward the retrospect of the 1930s, which is also the prospect on the next, now inevitable, war. The authors featured include combatant and civilian writers, names well-known and not so famous: Mann, Apollinaire, Owen, Pound, Cocteau, H.D., Woolf, Maurois, West, Celine, Joyce, Musil, Eliot, Rosenberg, Sassoon, Graves, Hardy, Trakl, Stramm, Lichtenstein, Pguy, Barbusse, Manning, J_nger, Zweig, Brittain, and Kroner. All readings for class will be in English translation.

TBA,L53 Film 114," This course will examine seven of the most popular, influential science fiction films that have one element in common: they are all adaptations of a previously published science fiction novel (or in one case a play by Shakespeare). The story may involve aliens, androids, space travel or other worlds, but the original imagery and inspiration comes from the written word. How does film translate or adapt the written word, particularly in a genre as imaginative and fantastical as science fiction? What is simplified? Or, conversely, magnified? Made more visually expressive but at the same time less ambiguous in meaning? Comparisons between film and written versions will allow the class to examine closely the unique qualities of each medium of expression, without valuing one over the other. Films and novels to be studied include: The Day the Earth Stood Still; War of the Worlds; Forbidden Planet; 2001; Solaris; Blade Runner; and Starship Trooper.

This course will offer an overview of French cinema, including the origins of film (Lumire brothers, Mlis), the inventive silent period (which created such avant-garde classics as Un chien andalou), the poetic realism of the 30s, the difficulties of the war years, the post-war emphasis on historical/nationalist themes in the ""tradition of quality"" films, the French New Wave's attempt to create a more ""cinematic"" style, the effects of the political turmoil of May '68 on film culture, the ""art house"" reception of French films in the US, and the broader appeal of recent hyper-visual (""cinma du look"") films, such as La Femme Nikita and Amlie. While the primary focus of the course will be on French cinema, we will also discuss the reciprocal influences between American and French film culture, both in terms of formal influences on filmmaking and theoretical approaches to film studies.

The course will seek to develop an understanding of each individual film both as an expression of a national culture as well as a possible response to international movements in other art forms. Throughout, the course will consider how various national cinemas sought ways of dealing with the pervasiveness of Hollywood films, developing their own distinctive styles, which could in turn influence American cinema itself.

TBA,L53 Film 345," Emerging in American films most forcefully during the 1940s, film noir is a cycle of films associated with a distinctive visual style and a cynical worldview. In this course, we will explore the sexual politics of film noir as a distinctive vision of American sexual relations every bit as identifiable as the form's stylized lighting and circuitous storytelling. We will explore how and why sexual paranoia and perversion seem to animate this genre and why these movies continue to influence ""neo-noir"" filmmaking into the 21st century, even as film noir's representation of gender and sexuality is inseparable from its literary antecedents, most notably, the so-called ""hard-boiled"" school of writing. We will read examples from this literature by Dashiell Hammett, James Cain, Raymond Chandler and Cornell Woolrich, and discuss these novels and short stories in the context of other artistic and cultural influences on gendered power relations and film noir. We will also explore the relationship of these films to censorship and to changing post-World War II cultural values. Films to be screened in complete prints or in excerpts will likely include many of the following: The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, Murder My Sweet, Phantom Lady, Strangers on a Train, The Big Sleep, The Killers, Mildred Pierce, The High Wall, Sudden Fear, The Big Combo, Laura, The Glass Key, The Big Heat, Kiss Me Deadly, The Crimson Kimono, Touch of Evil, Alphaville, Chinatown, Taxi Driver, Devil in a Blue Dress, The Bad Lieutenant, and Memento.

TBA,L53 Film 423," Entertainment and communications forms combine and blend, and they have done so across millennia. However, the phenomenon of media convergence has taken on a special salience over the last one-and-a-half-centuries, as exemplified by the growing intermixture of film, radio, television, gaming, and the internet. In particular, critics, consumers, politicians, and producers used convergence as structuring principle in understanding, regulating, and planning for the future of media culture. This course engages with contemporary worries and enthusiasms about convergence by considering the specific conditions in which the phenomenon has been understood and practiced. Tracing a historical arc though the Twentieth Century, we will first examine convergences of radio and film, film and music publishing, television and film exhibition, and disparate corporate entities as basis for understanding more recent media combinations. Building on that foundation, the majority of the course will consist of case studies of media convergence since 1980, considering it in terms of industry, technology, regulation, and audiences. These case studies will also provide students with a survey of and inquiry into questions of historiographic theory and method.

This course provides an introduction to those iconoclastic filmmakers, who went on to break with major studios and revolutionize oppositional filmmaking in Japan. We will analyze the challenging politics and aesthetics of these confrontational films for what they tell us about Japan's modern history and cinema. The films provoke as well as entertain, providing trenchant (sometimes absurd) commentaries on postwar Japanese society and its transformations. Themes include: the legacy of WWII and Japanese imperialism; the student movement; juvenile delinquency; sexual liberation; and Tokyo subcultures. Directors include: Oshima Nagisa, Shinoda Masahiro, Terayama Shuji, Masumura Yasuzo, Suzuki Seijun, Matsumoto Toshio, and others. No knowledge of Japanese necessary. Credit 3 units.

This is the period of an emerging cultural nationalism, a great efflorescence of literature in many genres, and some of the most important political, social, and military events in modern Irish history. One of the remarkable things about the period is the close relationship between prominent figures in the literary and artistic world and those in the realm of politics and social change. The result was a rich cross-fertilization of ideas and attitudes which had enormous implications for the future of this embattled island nation.

Of central importance are the Art Exhibits from Germany and Austria with their cultural-political implications. The German Emperor had a hand in selecting the German paintings to be sent to St. Louis, and his opposition against modern movements like Impressionism caused opposition in Germany. Austria was different: In their Art Nouveau Pavilion they included secessionists (Hagenbund). The Wiener Werkstaetten (Vienna's Workshops) attracted a lot of attention. Different from the paintings, German Arts and Crafts represented avant-garde movements. We will visit libraries, archives, and museums in St. Louis that have World's Fair holdings.

The course will include 1) readings on networks from philosophy and cultural criticism; 2) a consideration of origins and aims of network analysis as emerged in the sociology of the twentieth century; 3) a practical introduction to the methods of network analysis as it is currently used in the social sciences and humanities; and 4) a review of some recent network-analytical scholarship in the humanities, on topics ranging from correspondence networks and networks of literary characters to network approaches to modeling intellectual influence and the dissemination of ideas. We will meet twice weekly, once for a two-hour discussion and once for a one-hour, hands-on lab where students will learn to analyze networks using software packages such as Gephi and UCINET.

TBA,L21 German 520," Whether oral or written, whether everyday or literary elevated storytelling, whether books, films, plays, opera, or dance, much of our experience is condensed in stories. As studies in the field of narrative psychology and cognitive theory have shown, there is good reason to assume that the way we experience our environment is based on preconscious, proto-narrative scripts that help us guide our way through the complexities of our everyday world. But how do we tell stories? And did humans at all times tell stories in the same or similar ways? In this seminar, we will explore how twelfth- and early-thirteenth-century literary cultures, in Germany, moulded their experiences as narrative. We will look at the specifics of medieval German storytelling, study contemporary tools of narrative theory, and ask if and to what extent they are applicable to pre-modern narrative. Possible readings include: excerpts from the so-called ""Spielmannsepik"" (K_nig Rother, Herzog Ernst); medieval heroic epics (the German Rolandslied, the Nibelungenlied); Middle High German Arthurian romance (Hartmann von Aue, Wolfram von Eschenbach). Through short introductory modules on Middle High German, the course also enables students without previous exposure to medieval German to read and interpret the texts in their original language.",The Art of Storytelling in Medieval German Literature,-T-----,3,3:00P-5:30P,Schneider,,1,

Affirmative cultural artifacts and phenomena will be contrasted with literary works that give voice to discontent and unease with developments after 1871. Throughout we will discuss the continued uncomfortable presence of the French in and French influence on the German imaginary as well as the discomfort that integrating disparate territories within the Empire creates, where natives of one province are strangers in another and where members of ethnic subgroups figure as strangers. We will also examine the new awareness of alien peoples and places beyond continental Europe in the wake of Germany's belated colonialism. Finally we will consider how modern times, figured as strangers and strangeness, obstruct and intrude in the formation and maintenance of conservative imperial culture. Authors treated include Fontane, Thomas Mann, Raabe, Reuter, Storm, Viebig, Wagner, and others.

This graduate-level course will investigate artistic mediations of the Holocaust, focusing in particular on questions of ethics, aesthetics and history and concentrating on two objectives. First, we will examine the various debates and controversies surrounding the issue of artistic representation of the Holocaust and discuss some of the theoretical and philosophical texts that have formed the core of Holocaust Studies by critics such as James Young, Dominick LaCapra, Marianne Hirsch, Sidra Ezrahi, and Geoffrey Hartman. Second, we will explore the ways in which literature and film, both fictional and documentary/testimonial, have attempted to narrate the events of the Holocaust. We will examine exemplary responses to the Shoah in a variety of genres by writers and filmmakers such as Primo Levi, Jean Amry, Jurek Becker, Aaron Appelfeld, Liana Millu, David Grossman, Edgar Hilsenrath, Art Spiegelman, Claude Lanzmann and Alain Resnais. Central to our exploration of these texts will be issues of representation, the role of memory, the problems and limits of language, questions of trauma, the phenomena of postmemory and multidirectional memory, and the notion that a ""master narrative"" of the Holocaust has emerged in public discourse.

TBA,L74 HBRW 359," Jewish literature includes a number of highly fascinating travel accounts and autobiographies that are still awaiting their discovery by a broader readership. In this course, we will explore a broad range of texts originating from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. They were written by both Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews hailing from countries as diverse as Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire. Among the authors were pilgrims, rabbis, merchants, and one savvy business woman. We will read their works as responses to historical circumstances and as expressions of Jewish identity, in its changing relationship to the Christian or Muslim environment in which the writers lived or traveled. Specifically, we will ask questions such as: How do travel accounts and autobiographies enable their authors and readers to reflect on issues of identity and difference? How do the writers produce representations of an ""other,"" against which and through which they define a particular sense of self? To what extent are these texts reliable accounts of their authors' personal experiences, and where do they serve their own self-fashioning? How do the writers portray Christians, Muslims, and Jews from other cultural backgrounds than their own? How do they construe the role of women in a world dominated by men? How do they reflect on history, geography, and other fields of knowledge that were not covered by the traditional Jewish curriculum; and how do they respond to the challenges and opportunities of early modernity? This course is open to students of varying interests, including Jewish, Islamic, or Religious Studies, medieval and early modern history, European or Near Eastern literatures.

TBA,L74 HBRW 4001," This seminar will provide an opportunity to explore in some depth various facets of the convivencia (coexistence) of Muslims, Jews, and Christians in medieval Iberia. We will pick up the timeline with the emergence of an Ibero-Islamic society in the 8th century CE; the seminar's historical horizon stretches up to the turn of the 16th century, when Spanish Jews and Muslims were equally faced with the choice between exile and conversion to Christianity. Until about 1100, Muslims dominated most of the Iberian Peninsula; from then onward, Christians ruled much and eventually all of Spain and Portugal. Through a process termed, from a Christian perspective, as reconquista (Reconquest), Catholic kingdoms acquired large Muslim enclaves. As borders moved, Jewish communities found themselves under varying Muslim or Christian dominion, or migrated from one realm to the other. Interactions between the three ethno-religious communities occurred throughout, some characterized by mutual respect and shared creativity and others by rivalry and strife. The course focuses on these religious and cultural encounters, placing them in various historical and geographic contexts. It will raise questions concerning the ambiguities of religious change, and the interplay of persecution and toleration. Methodologically, the seminar emphasizes the study of primary sources, including documentary, historiographical, literary and poetical texts. Structurally, the course divides into four main parts. Part 1 will cover the political and cultural history of Iberia from the 8th to the early 16th centuries; part 2 will be devoted to the Jewish experience under Muslim rule; and part 3 to the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Christian Spain. In part 4, we will discuss primary sources originating from each of the three communities that are portraying the respective Other. All sources will be read in English translation; however, students are encouraged to make use of their linguistic and cultural expertise acquired in previous classes. This is the capstone seminar for Jewish, Islamic, & Near Eastern Studies majors, Arabic majors, and Hebrew majors.

The world's largest secular democracy since independence in 1947, India has witnessed the rising ascendancy of the Hindu Right since the early 1990s. In its wake, the Hindu Right has brought violence against minorities; curbs on free speech; and moves toward second-class citizenship for Indian Muslims. This course will track the history of the Hindu Right in India from its nineteenth century roots to the present.

First, we examine the Puritan sermon that politicians quote when they describe America as a ""city on a hill."" This sermon has been called the ""ur-text"" of American literature, the foundational document of American culture. Learning and drawing from multiple literary methodologies, we will re-investigate what that sermon means and how it came to tell a story about the Puritan origins of American culture -- a thesis our class will reassess with the help of modern critics. In the second part of this class, we broaden our discussion to consider the wider (and newer) meanings of American exceptionalism, theorizing the concept while looking at the way it has been revitalized, redefined and redeployed in recent years. Finally, the course ends with a careful study of American exceptionalism in modern political rhetoric, starting with JFK and proceeding through Reagan to the current day. Our last days will be spent discussing the rhetoric and legacy of American exceptionalism in the speeches of Obama and Trump.

One of the main purposes of the course is to investigate the phenomenon of majority/minority relations, to examine the ways in which the Jewish community interacted with and experienced European societies, cultures, and politics. We will look at the dynamics of boundary formation and cultural distinctiveness; the limits of religious and social tolerance; the periodic eruption of persecution in its social, political, and religious contexts; and the prospects for Jewish integration into various European societies during the course of the Enlightenment era.

TBA,L22 History 3354," The term Central Europe evokes the names of Freud and Mahler; Kafka and Kundera; Herzl, Lukcs, and Konrd. In politics, it evokes images of revolution and counter-revolution, ethnic nationalism, fascism, and communism. Both culture and politics, in fact, were deeply embedded in the structures of empire (in our case, the Habsburg Monarchy)-structures which both balanced and exacerbated ethnic, religious, and social struggles-in modern state formation, and in the emergence of creative and dynamic urban centers, of which Vienna, Budapest, and Prague were the most visible. This course seeks to put all of these elements into play-empire, nation, urban space, religion, and ethnicity-in order to illustrate what it has meant to be modern, creative, European, nationalist, or cosmopolitan since the 19th century. It engages current debates on nationalism and national identity; the viability of empires as supra-national constructs; urbanism and modern culture; the place of Jews in the social and cultural fabric of Central Europe; migration; and authoritarian and violent responses to modernity.

In this class we will examine the world of ancient Greco-Roman sport and spectacle, seeking to better understand both ancient culture and our own.

In this course we will focus our attention on the blind spot that Keynes so astutely identified. We will study seminal works in the history of political economy (Smith, Malthus, Marx, Keynes, Krugman, etc.) and explore the social, economic, and political histories in which they were grounded. We will begin with the Industrial Revolution in Britain, the works of Adam Smith, and the emergence of political economy as a field of inquiry.

TBA,L22 History 3599," Jewish literature includes a number of highly fascinating travel accounts and autobiographies that are still awaiting their discovery by a broader readership. In this course, we will explore a broad range of texts originating from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. They were written by both Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews hailing from countries as diverse as Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire. Among the authors were pilgrims, rabbis, merchants, and one savvy business woman. We will read their works as responses to historical circumstances and as expressions of Jewish identity, in its changing relationship to the Christian or Muslim environment in which the writers lived or traveled. Specifically, we will ask questions such as: How do travel accounts and autobiographies enable their authors and readers to reflect on issues of identity and difference? How do the writers produce representations of an ""other,"" against which and through which they define a particular sense of self? To what extent are these texts reliable accounts of their authors' personal experiences, and where do they serve their own self-fashioning? How do the writers portray Christians, Muslims, and Jews from other cultural backgrounds than their own? How do they construe the role of women in a world dominated by men? How do they reflect on history, geography, and other fields of knowledge that were not covered by the traditional Jewish curriculum; and how do they respond to the challenges and opportunities of early modernity? This course is open to students of varying interests, including Jewish, Islamic, or Religious Studies, medieval and early modern history, European or Near Eastern literatures.

The remainder of the course focuses on aspects of the cultural, economic, political and social experiences of Caribbean peoples during the twentieth century. Major areas of inquiry include the labor rebellions of the 1930s, decolonization, diasporic alliances, Black Power, identity construction and the politics of tourism. While the English-speaking Caribbean constitutes the main focus, references will be made to other areas such as Cuba and Haiti. Additionally, the Caribbean will be considered in a multilayered way with a view to investigating the local (actors within national boundaries), the regional (historical events that have rendered the region a unit of analysis) and the global (larger globalizing forces such as capitalism, colonialism, migration and slavery that have made the Caribbean central to world history).

TBA,L22 History 3662," Between 1957 and 1975, one African territory after another made the transition from European colony to independent nation state. Widespread optimism that these ""transfers of power"" would bring a new era of prosperity and dignity dissipated quickly as the new nations struggled with political instability, military coups, social unrest, and persistent poverty. Consequently many western observers and development specialists are certain that they have become ""failed states"" requiring foreign assistance to develop properly. This course challenges these assumptions by tracing the origins of African governance and economic development from their imperial origins into the independence era. By exploring nation-building, economic planning, and public administration from the perspective of political elites, foreign experts, and ordinary people the class takes an intimate look at how colonies became nation states. These new perspectives offer students a historical grounding in international public administration and development by exploring how imperial ideas and concepts continue to influence contemporary social planning and development policy in both Africa and the wider world.

TBA,L22 History 4010," This seminar will provide an opportunity to explore in some depth various facets of the convivencia (coexistence) of Muslims, Jews, and Christians in medieval Iberia. We will pick up the timeline with the emergence of an Ibero-Islamic society in the 8th century CE; the seminar's historical horizon stretches up to the turn of the 16th century, when Spanish Jews and Muslims were equally faced with the choice between exile and conversion to Christianity. Until about 1100, Muslims dominated most of the Iberian Peninsula; from then onward, Christians ruled much and eventually all of Spain and Portugal. Through a process termed, from a Christian perspective, as reconquista (Reconquest), Catholic kingdoms acquired large Muslim enclaves. As borders moved, Jewish communities found themselves under varying Muslim or Christian dominion, or migrated from one realm to the other. Interactions between the three ethno-religious communities occurred throughout, some characterized by mutual respect and shared creativity and others by rivalry and strife. The course focuses on these religious and cultural encounters, placing them in various historical and geographic contexts. It will raise questions concerning the ambiguities of religious change, and the interplay of persecution and toleration. Methodologically, the seminar emphasizes the study of primary sources, including documentary, historiographical, literary and poetical texts. Structurally, the course divides into four main parts. Part 1 will cover the political and cultural history of Iberia from the 8th to the early 16th centuries; part 2 will be devoted to the Jewish experience under Muslim rule; and part 3 to the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Christian Spain. In part 4, we will discuss primary sources originating from each of the three communities that are portraying the respective Other. All sources will be read in English translation; however, students are encouraged to make use of their linguistic and cultural expertise acquired in previous classes. This is the capstone seminar for Jewish, Islamic, & Near Eastern Studies majors, Arabic majors, and Hebrew majors. Graduate students and advanced undergrads in other relevant fields are likewise welcome.","CAPSTONE SEMINAR: Convivencia or Reconquista?

We plan to examine the development of political concepts and themes as articulated in diverse literary genres (legal, theological, political) from the 8th through the 13th century. We hope to engage various theoretical models to analyze the relationship between politics and religion and tease out the role of power in determining socio-political relations, distinctions, and structures.

TBA,L22 History 4633," Latin America was arguably one of the most ""revolutionary"" regions of the world in the twentieth century. It registered four ""great revolutions"": Mexico 1910, Bolivia 1952, Cuba 1959, and Nicaragua 1979. These social revolutions entailed a substantial, violent, and voluntarist struggle for political power and the overthrow of the established political, economic, social, and cultural orders. In the wake of these successful revolutions, new revolutionary institutions of governance were founded, radical structural changes were implemented, and a new revolutionary ethos was adopted. With the exception perhaps of the Bolivian Revolution, these revolutions had a profound impact on Latin American and world politics.

We will spend time engaging in a historical analysis of the social, economic, and racial dynamics that defined drug addiction in popular imagination, and examine how these factors contributed to discussions about legality, access to substances, one's ability to be rehabilitated, and criminal status. Regarding criminality we will particularly explore sociological and theoretical perspectives of labeling, habitual and occasional offenders, and moral panic in order to understand how racial minority groups were targeted for different rhetorical, legislative, and economic purposes. One major goal of the course will be to outline the early 20th century beginnings of the war on drugs and connect it to the century long growth of a militarized police system and prison industrial complex. We will secondly work to understand the role of local and national political actors, law enforcement, and the media in manufacturing and maintaining connections between race, crime and drugs. Ultimately, we will use our study of drugs to contextualize 21st century issues of police violence, increases in homicide in minority communities, mass incarceration, poverty, segregation, and mass movements of protest.

TBA,L93 IPH 171," Societies are typically divided into classes. The upper-class of society tends to be composed of those individuals who enjoy high degrees of wealth and influence and have many opportunities open to them. The middle-class commands relatively less wealth and influence and has far fewer opportunities than the upper class, but nevertheless still enjoy a comfortable situation in society. The lower-class, by contrast, has far less wealth and influence and far fewer opportunities than other classes. In some societies, this division between classes is institutionalized (e.g. caste systems). However, in many societies it arises as something of a by-product of a society's political and economic policies (e.g. capitalism). But in both cases, the division of societies into social classes inevitably leads to conflicts - or struggles - between the competing classes over jobs, resources, services, legal rights, and especially political power. Such struggles sometimes lead to an improvement of the situation of members of the middle-class and lower class. Other times, they merely lead to a furthering of the divisions between classes. This course will take an interdisciplinary approach to the notion of class struggle, examining it from sociological, historical, political, and ethical perspectives. We will grapple with the fact that most ""victories"" in class struggles are temporary, that the division of societies into classes is often viewed as a ""fact of life,"" and that individuals tend to incorporate their class membership into their personal identities, taking for granted all the benefits and disadvantages that comes said membership.",Freshman Seminar: Class and Class Struggle,M-W----,3,4:00P-5:30P,[TBA],,1,

The text itself is complex and layered, responding to its literary precursors, Enlightenment science, radical politics, aesthetic theory, feminism, Romantic idealism, Gothic horror, and more. In order to understand these influences, we will examine texts read by Mary Shelley (and her characters), including letters, essays, poems, and scientific reports. Our study of the novel's afterlives will begin with R. B. Peake's 1823 play, Presumption, which shaped much of the popular understanding of the Frankenstein myth during the 19th century. Our investigation of 20th- and 21st-century manifestations of Frankenstein will focus on its appearance in film, racial discourse, scientific ethics, popular culture, and advertising.

By immersing ourselves in the most distinctive literary voices from Korea, we examine how the Korean experience of modernization was filtered through its cultutral production. In class discussion, we pay special attention to the writers' construction of the self and the nation. How do social categories such as ethnicity, class, gender, and race figure in the varying images of the self? And how do these images relate to the literary vision of the nation?

TBA,L97 IAS 3662," Between 1957 and 1975, one African territory after another made the transition from European colony to independent nation state. Widespread optimism that these ""transfers of power"" would bring a new era of prosperity and dignity dissipated quickly as the new nations struggled with political instability, military coups, social unrest, and persistent poverty. Consequently many western observers and development specialists are certain that they have become ""failed states"" requiring foreign assistance to develop properly. This course challenges these assumptions by tracing the origins of African governance and economic development from their imperial origins into the independence era. By exploring nation-building, economic planning, and public administration from the perspective of political elites, foreign experts, and ordinary people the class takes an intimate look at how colonies became nation states. These new perspectives offer students a historical grounding in international public administration and development by exploring how imperial ideas and concepts continue to influence contemporary social planning and development policy in both Africa and the wider world.

What do we mean when we speak of ethnic identities and ethnic mobilization? Why and how does salience of ethnic identities change over time and space? What are the political consequences of ethnic divisions? These are some of the main questions we will cover during the semester. We will start the semester with an exploration of the meaning of ethnic identity and the factors that motivate individuals to develop attachments to ethnic groups. We will then turn to discussing when, why and how ethnicity matters in politics. We will study different theories of ethnically based identification and mobilization. We will then move on to examine different types of ethnic conflict, ranging from ethnic violence in civil war to ethnic riots.

Of central importance are the Art Exhibits from Germany and Austria with their cultural-political implications. The German Emperor had a hand in selecting the German paintings to be sent to St. Louis, and his opposition against modern movements like Impressionism caused opposition in Germany. Austria was different: In their Art Nouveau Pavilion they included secessionists (Hagenbund). The Wiener Werkstaetten (Vienna's Workshops) attracted a lot of attention. Different from the paintings, German Arts and Crafts represented avant-garde movements. We will visit libraries, archives, and museums in St. Louis that have World's Fair holdings.

These social revolutions entailed a substantial, violent, and voluntarist struggle for political power and the overthrow of the established political, economic, social, and cultural orders. In the wake of these successful revolutions, new revolutionary institutions of governance were founded, radical structural changes were implemented, and a new revolutionary ethos was adopted.

TBA,L97 IAS 482," Although women of premodern China have often been portrayed as little more than long-suffering victims of male patriarchy and sexual repression, their lives were far more complicated, diverse, and interesting. Women played roles as filial daughters, dutiful wives, and devoted mothers, but also as proud courtesans, clever entrepreneurs, educated scholars and teachers, independent nuns, fierce warriors and even powerful rulers. In this course we will begin with a broad overview of the ideal traditional roles for women established in early China. We will then move on to a general exploration of some of the ways women were represented in classical literature by male writers. Our main focus, however, will be on how, over time, more and more women took up the brush and began to write themselves. In so doing they were able to express their own subjectivity and often radically reinscribe many of the notions of femininity and of female roles that were dominant during their times. We will conclude with a discussion of ways in which traditional women writers both anticipated and contributed to the 20th century transition to modernity.

TBA,L97 IAS 483," The course will focus on the definitions, uses and ""languages"" of violence in Latin America, particularly during the last decades of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century. Students will be introduced to philosophical, ethical and political issues related to the existence of ""structural"" violence and to the problems connected to the symbolic representation of this phenomenon in literature, fictional/ documentary films, and visual arts. One of the course's objectives will be to problematize the conceptualization of violence and to promote critical thinking about its emergence, significance and effects on local/global societies. Some of the topics to be analyzed are the body in its multiple manifestations (the body politic, the social body, the individual body, the treatment of the corpse, etc.), the narrativization of violence (violence as discourse, documentation and fictional elaborations, violence and the media, violence and ideology, etc.), violence and the city, citizenry and otherness, bio-politics, etc. Finally, violence will be presented in different contexts and associated to different activities (ordinary crime, narco-cultures, maras, political movements, domestic environments) and different situations (e.g. violence in rural areas, violence in the borderlands, violence and migration). In all cases the course will call for a reflection on the interrelations between private/public spheres, gender politics, ideological/aesthetic values, and individual/ institutional levels. The role of memory and emotions will be emphasized as a crucial element for the construction /mobilization of subjectivity and for the elaboration of agendas that challenge the State's monopoly of legitimate violence and propose alternative and often perverse forms of association and mobilization at the margins of institutional configurations.","Bodily Injuries: Violence, Fear and Representation in Latin America",M------,3,4:00P-7:00P,Moraa,,1,

Far wider than the concerns of any one national ideology, the literature of record represents a profound crisis in the European cultural imaginary. A number of critical and interpretive issues will be in play in our readings, which will move through three major phases. We begin with the powerful immediacy of trench poetry (1914-1919), develop into the constructed narratives of the great postwar novels and memoirs (1920-1931), and then turn toward the retrospect of the 1930s, which is also the prospect on the next, now inevitable, war.

We will analyze the challenging politics and aesthetics of these confrontational films for what they tell us about Japan's modern history and cinema. The films provoke as well as entertain, providing trenchant (sometimes absurd) commentaries on postwar Japanese society and its transformations. Themes include: the legacy of WWII and Japanese imperialism; the student movement; juvenile delinquency; sexual liberation; and Tokyo subcultures.

TBA,L75 JINE 359," Jewish literature includes a number of highly fascinating travel accounts and autobiographies that are still awaiting their discovery by a broader readership. In this course, we will explore a broad range of texts originating from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. They were written by both Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews hailing from countries as diverse as Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire. Among the authors were pilgrims, rabbis, merchants, and one savvy business woman. We will read their works as responses to historical circumstances and as expressions of Jewish identity, in its changing relationship to the Christian or Muslim environment in which the writers lived or traveled. Specifically, we will ask questions such as: How do travel accounts and autobiographies enable their authors and readers to reflect on issues of identity and difference? How do the writers produce representations of an ""other,"" against which and through which they define a particular sense of self? To what extent are these texts reliable accounts of their authors' personal experiences, and where do they serve their own self-fashioning? How do the writers portray Christians, Muslims, and Jews from other cultural backgrounds than their own? How do they construe the role of women in a world dominated by men? How do they reflect on history, geography, and other fields of knowledge that were not covered by the traditional Jewish curriculum; and how do they respond to the challenges and opportunities of early modernity? This course is open to students of varying interests, including Jewish, Islamic, or Religious Studies, medieval and early modern history, European or Near Eastern literatures.

TBA,L75 JINE 4001," This seminar will provide an opportunity to explore in some depth various facets of the convivencia (coexistence) of Muslims, Jews, and Christians in medieval Iberia. We will pick up the timeline with the emergence of an Ibero-Islamic society in the 8th century CE; the seminar's historical horizon stretches up to the turn of the 16th century, when Spanish Jews and Muslims were equally faced with the choice between exile and conversion to Christianity. Until about 1100, Muslims dominated most of the Iberian Peninsula; from then onward, Christians ruled much and eventually all of Spain and Portugal. Through a process termed, from a Christian perspective, as reconquista (Reconquest), Catholic kingdoms acquired large Muslim enclaves. As borders moved, Jewish communities found themselves under varying Muslim or Christian dominion, or migrated from one realm to the other. Interactions between the three ethno-religious communities occurred throughout, some characterized by mutual respect and shared creativity and others by rivalry and strife. The course focuses on these religious and cultural encounters, placing them in various historical and geographic contexts. It will raise questions concerning the ambiguities of religious change, and the interplay of persecution and toleration. Methodologically, the seminar emphasizes the study of primary sources, including documentary, historiographical, literary and poetical texts. Structurally, the course divides into four main parts. Part 1 will cover the political and cultural history of Iberia from the 8th to the early 16th centuries; part 2 will be devoted to the Jewish experience under Muslim rule; and part 3 to the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Christian Spain. In part 4, we will discuss primary sources originating from each of the three communities that are portraying the respective Other. All sources will be read in English translation; however, students are encouraged to make use of their linguistic and cultural expertise acquired in previous classes. This is the capstone seminar for Jewish, Islamic, & Near Eastern Studies majors, Arabic majors, and Hebrew majors.

Among the authors were pilgrims, rabbis, merchants, and one savvy business woman. We will read their works as responses to historical circumstances and as expressions of Jewish identity, in its changing relationship to the Christian or Muslim environment in which the writers lived or traveled. Specifically, we will ask questions such as: How do travel accounts and autobiographies enable their authors and readers to reflect on issues of identity and difference? How do the writers produce representations of an ""other,"" against which and through which they define a particular sense of self? To what extent are these texts reliable accounts of their authors' personal experiences, and where do they serve their own self-fashioning? How do the writers portray Christians, Muslims, and Jews from other cultural backgrounds than their own? How do they construe the role of women in a world dominated by men? How do they reflect on history, geography, and other fields of knowledge that were not covered by the traditional Jewish curriculum; and how do they respond to the challenges and opportunities of early modernity? This course is open to students of varying interests, including Jewish, Islamic, or Religious Studies, medieval and early modern history, European or Near Eastern literatures. All texts will be read in English translation.","Travelers, Tricksters, and Storytellers: Jewish Travel Narratives and Autobiographies",-T-R---,3,11:30A-1:00P,Jacobs,,1,

TBA,L51 Korean 352," This undergraduate course surveys the major writers and works of 20th century Korean literature. During the 20th century Korea went through a radical process of modernization. From its colonization by Japan, to its suffering of a civil war within the cold war order, to its growth into a cultural and economic powerhouse, Korea's historical experience is at once unique and typical of that of a third-world nation. By immersing ourselves in the most distinctive literary voices from Korea, we examine how the Korean experience of modernization was filtered through its cultutral production. In class discussion, we pay special attention to the writers' construction of the self and the nation. How do social categories such as ethnicity, class, gender, and race figure in the varying images of the self? And how do these images relate to the literary vision of the nation? Along the way, we observe the prominent ideas, themes, and genres of Korean literature. This class combines discussion with lecture with students strongly encouraged to participate.

TBA,L45 LatAm 4633," Latin America was arguably one of the most ""revolutionary"" regions of the world in the twentieth century. It registered four ""great revolutions"": Mexico 1910, Bolivia 1952, Cuba 1959, and Nicaragua 1979. These social revolutions entailed a substantial, violent, and voluntarist struggle for political power and the overthrow of the established political, economic, social, and cultural orders. In the wake of these successful revolutions, new revolutionary institutions of governance were founded, radical structural changes were implemented, and a new revolutionary ethos was adopted. With the exception perhaps of the Bolivian Revolution, these revolutions had a profound impact on Latin American and world politics. The primary aim of this course is to analyze and compare the causes, processes, and outcomes of the Mexican, Cuban, and Nicaraguan revolutions.",Twentieth Century Latin American Revolutions,-T-R---,3,11:30A-1:00P,Hirsch,,1,

We will highlight the uneven processes of development at multiple, overlapping scales and the power imbalances inherent in much of development discourse. In the second half of the course we will focus our considerations towards specific contemporary trends and development issues, utilizing case studies drawn primarily from Latin America. These themes will include sustainability, NGOs, social movements, social capital, security and conflict, identity, ethnicity and gender issues, participatory development, and micro-credit and conditional cash transfers. Students will acquire the critical theoretical tools to develop their own perspectives on how development geographies play out in Latin America.",Geographies of Development in Latin America: Critical Perspectives and Contemporary Challenges,-T-----,3,4:00P-7:00P,Clouser,,1,
TBA,L45 LatAm 483," The course will focus on the definitions, uses and ""languages"" of violence in Latin America, particularly during the last decades of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century. Students will be introduced to philosophical, ethical and political issues related to the existence of ""structural"" violence and to the problems connected to the symbolic representation of this phenomenon in literature, fictional/ documentary films, and visual arts. One of the course's objectives will be to problematize the conceptualization of violence and to promote critical thinking about its emergence, significance and effects on local/global societies. Some of the topics to be analyzed are the body in its multiple manifestations (the body politic, the social body, the individual body, the treatment of the corpse, etc.), the narrativization of violence (violence as discourse, documentation and fictional elaborations, violence and the media, violence and ideology, etc.), violence and the city, citizenry and otherness, bio-politics, etc. Finally, violence will be presented in different contexts and associated to different activities (ordinary crime, narco-cultures, maras, political movements, domestic environments) and different situations (e.g. violence in rural areas, violence in the borderlands, violence and migration). In all cases the course will call for a reflection on the interrelations between private/public spheres, gender politics, ideological/aesthetic values, and individual/ institutional levels. The role of memory and emotions will be emphasized as a crucial element for the construction /mobilization of subjectivity and for the elaboration of agendas that challenge the State's monopoly of legitimate violence and propose alternative and often perverse forms of association and mobilization at the margins of institutional configurations.","Bodily Injuries: Violence, Gender and Representation in Latin America",M------,3,4:00P-7:00P,Moraa,,1,
TBA,L45 LatAm 4876," Access to and ownership of land has been a major issue in Mexican history. Land tenure in economic development has been a constant source of tension and debate since the 18th century. Paradoxically, land tenure has been put forth as both the obstacle and the solution to the country's modernization. Given its centrality in the construction of the modern period, this course examines liberalism, agrarian revolts, the revolution, the green revolution and neoliberalism through the lens of land issues. This course will also explore how these have shaped and have been shaped by indigenous peoples and peasants, from land disentailment to the fight against GMO maize. Students will evaluate agrarian reforms, agricultural modernization programs, concepts of and transformations of natural resources, food production/consumption and social policies.

Whatever the case, diagnosing the status of democracy in the United States requires more than understanding today's headlines. Stepping back from contemporary debates, this seminar will examine the long history of American democracy from the signing of the Declaration of Independence to the opening days of the Trump administration. Some of the topics covered will include the tangled histories of slavery and freedom, the shifting boundaries of citizenship, the relationship between economic and political equality, the origins of political polarization, and the character of the American state. Grappling with these subjects raises a host of other issues. Is the United States a democracy today? Should it be one tomorrow? Was it ever really a democracy in the first place? This course will not supply answers to those questions, but it will provide you with tools to think about them for yourself.","Topics in American Culture Studies: American Democracy, from Tocqueville to Trump",-T-R---,3,1:00P-2:30P,Shenk,,1,

TBA,L84 Lw St 280," What would it mean to engage in effective social and structural analysis of the complex problems of modern American life that are so often reduced by policy makers to matters of individual choice and personal responsibility? This is an urgent question at a historical moment when American society is becoming more diverse and more unequal. Through a sociological lens, this course explores key areas of inequality: social class and poverty, racism and sexism, the crisis in health care, and the perils of globalization. We examine empirical underpinnings of these areas focusing on the intersection of statuses related to race, social class, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality that heighten risk for social and political disadvantages. Our investigation capitalizes on rich sources of multidisciplinary data and methods. These sources offer a foundation for an original research project allowing students to gain an understanding of the complexity of social problems emanating from inequality, and productive intellectual and policy responses. Guests from agencies dealing directly with these issues will share perspectives. Students will emerge from the course with critical skills that empower them to decipher contemporary policy debates and develop their own critical analyses.",Exploring Inequality: The Social and Structural Analysis of Modern American Life,M-W----,3,8:30A-10:00A,Lindsey,,1,

TBA,L84 Lw St 314W," Most legal practice consists not of fine oratory but rather of great writing. However, it is not only lawyers who need to be able to incorporate the law into their professional practice: in this course, we will look at the many different types of writing in and about the law to see how the principles of rhetoric must be used to persuade in different ways depending on the writer's purpose. We will learn the skills necessary to adapt the framing of our writing to its audience as we think about how we might persuade a judge, a lay client, a community, a committee or other professionals. We will consider the psychological effects of our writing and how we seek to persuade our readers not only with the strength of our reasoning but with the power of our emotional appeal to their particular interests. We will learn how to think and write about the law in a range of circumstances as assignments cover writing for business about implications of laws, reporting about a law for the popular press, investigating a legal issue and explaining a law's ramifications as well as attempting to encourage support for a particular law; this is not, however, a technical legal writing course. Readings will be drawn from statutes and judgments but more commonly from academic, business and popular examples of writing on the interpretation of laws governing topical concerns. Issues to be dealt with may include the extent of police/citizens' rights to protect themselves (so-called Stand Your Ground laws); rights to refuse medical treatment (Cruzan v Director, Missouri Dept of Health); religious groups' rights to discriminate (The Religious Freedom Restoration Act); Open Carry laws (St. Louis Zoo v Smith); immigration proposals such as The Dream Act; reform of mandatory prison sentences.",Topics in Composition: Writing and the Law,M-W----,3,11:30A-1:00P,Thomas,,1,

TBA,L84 Lw St 315R," This course takes morality and the question of ""what's right"" seriously as a lens through which to understand and assess modern American history. ""Morality"" is, of course, a devilishly flexible rhetoric, a language invoked to tell people how to act and how to be good, or, conversely, to criticize and to shame. When the state or a community wants its citizens or members to be ""good,"" it crafts laws and creates customs to encourage or inhibit behaviors. This class examines how state and non-state actors have attempted to regulate the lived experiences of Americans and the conflicts that emerge over what, exactly, is correct, or right, or good for individuals, society, and the state. It interrogates what values the state impresses upon its citizens and what values citizens want the state to uphold.","Virtues, Vices, Values: Regulating Morality in Modern America",-T-----,3,2:30P-5:30P,Griffith,,1,

TBA,L84 Lw St 3507," Thousands of lawsuits are filed daily in the state and federal courts of the United States. The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding both the conduct and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation ""literacy"" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that ""literacy"" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the duty of landlords to prevent criminal assaults on their tenants, groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police.

AB Law Bldg / 404,L84 Lw St 3561," This course (formerly called ""Women and the Law"") explores how social constructions of gender, race, class, and sexuality have shaped traditional legal reasoning and American legal concepts, including women's legal rights. We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context. We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives. For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (or women and men) use the law to gain greater equality? What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality? What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists? How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women. Over the years, this course has attracted WGSS students and pre-law students. This course is taught by law students under the supervision of a member of the School of Law faculty..

Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist."" In this course we will focus our attention on the blind spot that Keynes so astutely identified. We will study seminal works in the history of political economy (Smith, Malthus, Marx, Keynes, Krugman, etc.) and explore the social, economic, and political histories in which they were grounded. We will begin with the Industrial Revolution in Britain, the works of Adam Smith, and the emergence of political economy as a field of inquiry. We will end with the globalization of the 1970s, the works of Joseph Stiglitz, and the challenges that a more interconnected world has posed for both the organization of the economy and the practice of economics as a discipline.

Issues of national consciousness, post/colonialism, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, religion, dis/ability and the role of history/memory will remain central to our explorations of music and healing.",Music and Healing,M-W----,3,1:00P-2:30P,Gill,,1,

TBA,L30 Phil 2401," This course uses the concepts of political theory to explore the diverse Jewish political tradition. While this tradition includes writing from and about the three historical periods of Jewish self-rule (including the modern state of Israel), most of the Jewish political tradition comes from the understand of politics as viewed from outsiders to mainstream communities. Additionally, Jewish political thought can be found through a Jewish community's self-understanding based on its interpretation of Jewish text and law by which it bound itself. Because we span over 2,000 years of recorded history, we will not attempt to discern a single ""Jewish political thought"" but rather look at JPT through the lens of familiar concepts of political theory. The fundamental questions we will explore are the relationship of the Jewish tradition to concepts such as authority, law, consent, sovereignty, and justice. We will ask how the Jewish tradition views government and the relationship between the authority of God and the authority of temporal powers. We will explore these questions through a range of materials that include both primary and secondary literature.",Jewish Political Thought,-T-R---,3,10:00A-11:30A,Rehfeld,,1,

TBA,L30 Phil 3507," Thousands of lawsuits are filed daily in the state and federal courts of the United States. The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding both the conduct and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation ""literacy"" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that ""literacy"" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the duty of landlords to prevent criminal assaults on their tenants, groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police.

TBA,L30 Phil 358," We tend to associate certain ideas with ""science"". Science is ""objective,"" it involves empirical investigations of the natural world, specific methods, the development of theories, or more precisely, the identification of laws of nature. But, one could press these common sense generalizations a bit more: What does it mean to say science is objective"" - are scientists objective, and what does that mean, exactly? Are the methods of science objective, and exactly what does that mean? Can objectivity come by degrees? Is there a ""hard and fast"" distinction between science and non-science, or perhaps pseudo-science? What really makes something ""science""? This course is an introduction to exactly these questions. We will read texts in the history and philosophy of science. The philosophy of science is an exploration of the methods and aims of scientific inquiry. Philosophers of science have increasingly stressed the importance of close examination of episodes in the history of science in order to ground their explorations. So, a good part of the course will involve critical examination of concrete examples from different periods in the history of scientific ideas, and different scientific disciplines. Readings in history of science will vary by semester, but we will likely focus two periods: the ""Scientific Revolution"" (late 1500s to 1700) and the ""Darwinian revolution"" (1859-1930 or so).

TBA,L64 PNP 3581," We tend to associate certain ideas with ""science"". Science is ""objective,"" it involves empirical investigations of the natural world, specific methods, the development of theories, or more precisely, the identification of laws of nature. But, one could press these common sense generalizations a bit more: What does it mean to say science is objective"" - are scientists objective, and what does that mean, exactly? Are the methods of science objective, and exactly what does that mean? Can objectivity come by degrees? Is there a ""hard and fast"" distinction between science and non-science, or perhaps pseudo-science? What really makes something ""science""? This course is an introduction to exactly these questions. We will read texts in the history and philosophy of science. The philosophy of science is an exploration of the methods and aims of scientific inquiry. Philosophers of science have increasingly stressed the importance of close examination of episodes in the history of science in order to ground their explorations. So, a good part of the course will involve critical examination of concrete examples from different periods in the history of scientific ideas, and different scientific disciplines. Readings in history of science will vary by semester, but we will likely focus two periods: the ""Scientific Revolution"" (late 1500s to 1700) and the ""Darwinian revolution"" (1859-1930 or so).

TBA,L32 Pol Sci 3507," Thousands of lawsuits are filed daily in the state and federal courts of the United States. The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding both the conduct and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation ""literacy"" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that ""literacy"" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the duty of landlords to prevent criminal assaults on their tenants, groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police.

TBA,L32 Pol Sci 593," Territorial conflicts are among the most contentious and difficult to resolve in international politics. Territorial conflict is also found to be one of the most frequent causes of intrastate violence and civil war onset. At a theoretical level, territory is central to almost any aspect of international relations, as it is what physically defines states, where any kind of violent conflict takes place, and influences the character of violent conflict in important ways. A large empirical literature convincingly shows that territory is a key determinant of international conflict. However, much remains unexplored both theoretically and empirically. In this course, we explore the role that territory plays in a wide variety of contexts. We motivate the course by noting that although territory has been shown to be empirically central to the majority of violent disputes, explanations for why this is the case lag behind the evidence. Subsequently, we study the role territory plays in state-making, international conflict, the settlement of disputes, international trade, international investment, the effectiveness of treaties, ethnic identity, and civil wars, among others. Week by week we pay particular attention to the central theoretical role territory plays in international relations.

Psychology / 215B,L33 Psych 5991," In this graduate seminar, our focus is on the field of social cognition, defined broadly. Altnough the field of social cognition initialy had a strong focus on cognitive processes, students should keep in mind that the term, as currently employed, fully embraces emotion, both as it relates to memory as well as attitudes. Indeed, a guiding principle of this course is that much of social behavior can be understood as an bidirectional interplay between memory, emotion, and attitudes. For example, retrieving a memory of a threatening event can automatically trigger different types of correlated but distinct negative emotions. These distinct affective states can, in, turn, exert different types of effects on different types of social attitudes. Also, the types of memories that are retrieved--and the ways that those memories are processed--can moderate the ways that emotion and attitudes are ultimately influenced.

TBA,L57 RelPol 102," Nearly everyone has had some experience with something they would call ""religion,"" from at least a passing familiarity through the media to a lifetime of active participation in religious communities. But what do we actually mean when we use the word? What is a religion? What does it mean to call something a religion, or ""religious""? And what does it mean to study religion, given the slipperiness of the concept itself? This course offers an introduction to the academic study of religion through a consideration of these questions: What is religion, and how can we study it? Do we need an answer to the first question to pursue the second? Why, and toward what ends, might we undertake such study? We will also consider what is at stake in our investigation and inquiry into religion-for the inquirers, for the subjects of inquiry, and for society more broadly-and what kind of lens the study of religion offers us on ourselves, our neighbors, and society, in turn. To these ends, we will discuss major theoretical approaches to the study of religion and significant work on religions and religious phenomena, toward a better understanding of what ""religion"" might be and how it might be studied today.

TBA,L57 RelPol 240," This course uses the concepts of political theory to explore the diverse Jewish political tradition. While this tradition includes writing from and about the three historical periods of Jewish self-rule (including the modern state of Israel), most of the Jewish political tradition comes from the understand of politics as viewed from outsiders to mainstream communities. Additionally, Jewish political thought can be found through a Jewish community's self-understanding based on its interpretation of Jewish text and law by which it bound itself. Because we span over 2,000 years of recorded history, we will not attempt to discern a single ""Jewish political thought"" but rather look at JPT through the lens of familiar concepts of political theory. The fundamental questions we will explore are the relationship of the Jewish tradition to concepts such as authority, law, consent, sovereignty, and justice. We will ask how the Jewish tradition views government and the relationship between the authority of God and the authority of temporal powers.

First, we examine the Puritan sermon that politicians quote when they describe America as a ""city on a hill."" This sermon has been called the ""ur-text"" of American literature, the foundational document of American culture. Learning and drawing from multiple literary methodologies, we will re-investigate what that sermon means and how it came to tell a story about the Puritan origins of American culture -- a thesis our class will reassess with the help of modern critics. In the second part of this class, we broaden our discussion to consider the wider (and newer) meanings of American exceptionalism, theorizing the concept while looking at the way it has been revitalized, redefined and redeployed in recent years. Finally, the course ends with a careful study of American exceptionalism in modern political rhetoric, starting with JFK and proceeding through Reagan to the current day. Our last days will be spent discussing the rhetoric and legacy of American exceptionalism in the speeches of Obama and Trump.

""Morality"" is, of course, a devilishly flexible rhetoric, a language invoked to tell people how to act and how to be good, or, conversely, to criticize and to shame. When the state or a community wants its citizens or members to be ""good,"" it crafts laws and creates customs to encourage or inhibit behaviors. This class examines how state and non-state actors have attempted to regulate the lived experiences of Americans and the conflicts that emerge over what, exactly, is correct, or right, or good for individuals, society, and the state. It interrogates what values the state impresses upon its citizens and what values citizens want the state to uphold.","Virtues, Vices, Values: Regulating Morality in Modern America",-T-----,3,2:30P-5:30P,Griffith,,1,

TBA,L57 RelPol 407," Although political action is often considered a problem of making oneself heard, religious practices of silence, self-effacement, and withdrawal from certain worldly struggles have guided many significant political and social movements, particularly forms of non-violent resistance. This course considers the role of religious thought and practice in such movements in the twentieth century. The history of these movements presents an apparent paradox: how can political action emerge from the supposedly ""private"" realm of religion in the modern era, particularly its most individualistic formations in contemplative and mystical practices? Does the historical role of these practices in the political sphere complicate their portrayal in some scholarship as private, individual, and depoliticizing? With these questions animating our investigations, we will consider the work of authors and activists including Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Martin Luther King, Jr., Simone Weil, and William Barber, as well as the history of movements associated with their work.

TBA,L23 Re St 102," Nearly everyone has had some experience with something they would call ""religion,"" from at least a passing familiarity through the media to a lifetime of active participation in religious communities. But what do we actually mean when we use the word? What is a religion? What does it mean to call something a religion, or ""religious""? And what does it mean to study religion, given the slipperiness of the concept itself? This course offers an introduction to the academic study of religion through a consideration of these questions: What is religion, and how can we study it? Do we need an answer to the first question to pursue the second? Why, and toward what ends, might we undertake such study? We will also consider what is at stake in our investigation and inquiry into religion-for the inquirers, for the subjects of inquiry, and for society more broadly-and what kind of lens the study of religion offers us on ourselves, our neighbors, and society, in turn. To these ends, we will discuss major theoretical approaches to the study of religion and significant work on religions and religious phenomena, toward a better understanding of what ""religion"" might be and how it might be studied today. No prior knowledge or experience of religion, religions, or anything religious is expected or required.

This course is designed for non-English majors as well as potential English majors. As we read some of the best, most influential, and most controversial writers of the last hundred years, we'll discuss not just the competing claims about religion and spirituality, but also the functions, forms, and multiple ways of interpreting literature. Studying the topic of religion and spirituality, this class will thus also serve as introduction to the discipline of English and literary studies.

TBA,L23 Re St 2400," This course uses the concepts of political theory to explore the diverse Jewish political tradition. While this tradition includes writing from and about the three historical periods of Jewish self-rule (including the modern state of Israel), most of the Jewish political tradition comes from the understand of politics as viewed from outsiders to mainstream communities. Additionally, Jewish political thought can be found through a Jewish community's self-understanding based on its interpretation of Jewish text and law by which it bound itself. Because we span over 2,000 years of recorded history, we will not attempt to discern a single ""Jewish political thought"" but rather look at JPT through the lens of familiar concepts of political theory. The fundamental questions we will explore are the relationship of the Jewish tradition to concepts such as authority, law, consent, sovereignty, and justice. We will ask how the Jewish tradition views government and the relationship between the authority of God and the authority of temporal powers. We will explore these questions through a range of materials that include both primary and secondary literature.",Jewish Political Thought,-T-R---,3,10:00A-11:30A,Rehfeld,,1,

TBA,L23 Re St 3080," This course examines the concept, history, and culture of American exceptionalism -- the idea that America has been specially chosen, or has a special mission to the world. First, we examine the Puritan sermon that politicians quote when they describe America as a ""city on a hill."" This sermon has been called the ""ur-text"" of American literature, the foundational document of American culture. Learning and drawing from multiple literary methodologies, we will re-investigate what that sermon means and how it came to tell a story about the Puritan origins of American culture -- a thesis our class will reassess with the help of modern critics. In the second part of this class, we broaden our discussion to consider the wider (and newer) meanings of American exceptionalism, theorizing the concept while looking at the way it has been revitalized, redefined and redeployed in recent years. Finally, the course ends with a careful study of American exceptionalism in modern political rhetoric, starting with JFK and proceeding through Reagan to the current day. Our last days will be spent discussing the rhetoric and legacy of American exceptionalism in the speeches of Obama and Trump. In the end, students will gain a firm grasp of the long history and continuing significance of this concept in American culture.",City on a Hill: The Concept and Culture of American Exceptionalism,-T-R---,3,2:30P-4:00P,Van Engen,,1,
TBA,L23 Re St 3091," This course is designed to introduce students to the history and teachings of one of the world's major religious traditions: Confucianism. We will examine how Confucianism developed in ancient China and afterwards spread throughout East Asia and beyond. In particular, we will pay attention to the issue of ritual and how Confucians attempted to ritualize social interactions and the world at large. In order to do so, we will engage in the writings of Confucius, Mengzi, and Xunzi, three early Chinese writers whose basic ideas about ritual heavily informed myriad cultural practices that are formative for large portions of East Asia today. Hence, this course on ancient thinkers not only introduces thoughts and practices prevalent throughout pre-modern China, Japan, and Korea. It also functions as a catalyst that helps us understand some of the reasons and motivations behind these communities' recent efforts to renegotiate and question ""the colonialist flavor"" of human rights and democracy.",Confucian Thought,M-W----,3,11:30A-1:00P,Zuern,,1,

""Morality"" is, of course, a devilishly flexible rhetoric, a language invoked to tell people how to act and how to be good, or, conversely, to criticize and to shame. When the state or a community wants its citizens or members to be ""good,"" it crafts laws and creates customs to encourage or inhibit behaviors. This class examines how state and non-state actors have attempted to regulate the lived experiences of Americans and the conflicts that emerge over what, exactly, is correct, or right, or good for individuals, society, and the state. It interrogates what values the state impresses upon its citizens and what values citizens want the state to uphold.","Virtues, Vices, Values: Regulating Morality in Modern America",-T-----,3,2:30P-5:30P,Griffith,,1,

We will examine the cultural and social implications of encounters between Native peoples, missionaries and other European and Euro-American Protestants and Catholics. We will pay particular attention to how bodies were a venue for encounter-through sexual contact, through the policing of gendered social and economic behaviors, and through religiously-based understandings of women's and men's duties and functions. We will also study how historians know what they know about these encounters, and what materials enable them to answer their historical questions.",Native American/Euro-American Encounters: Confrontations of Bodies and Beliefs,-T-R---,3,11:30A-1:00P,Croxall,,1,

One of the main purposes of the course is to investigate the phenomenon of majority/minority relations, to examine the ways in which the Jewish community interacted with and experienced European societies, cultures, and politics. We will look at the dynamics of boundary formation and cultural distinctiveness; the limits of religious and social tolerance; the periodic eruption of persecution in its social, political, and religious contexts; and the prospects for Jewish integration into various European societies during the course of the Enlightenment era.

TBA,L23 Re St 3354," The term Central Europe evokes the names of Freud and Mahler; Kafka and Kundera; Herzl, Lukcs, and Konrd. In politics, it evokes images of revolution and counter-revolution, ethnic nationalism, fascism, and communism. Both culture and politics, in fact, were deeply embedded in the structures of empire (in our case, the Habsburg Monarchy)-structures which both balanced and exacerbated ethnic, religious, and social struggles-in modern state formation, and in the emergence of creative and dynamic urban centers, of which Vienna, Budapest, and Prague were the most visible. This course seeks to put all of these elements into play-empire, nation, urban space, religion, and ethnicity-in order to illustrate what it has meant to be modern, creative, European, nationalist, or cosmopolitan since the 19th century. It engages current debates on nationalism and national identity; the viability of empires as supra-national constructs; urbanism and modern culture; the place of Jews in the social and cultural fabric of Central Europe; migration; and authoritarian and violent responses to modernity.

TBA,L23 Re St 359," Jewish literature includes a number of highly fascinating travel accounts and autobiographies that are still awaiting their discovery by a broader readership. In this course, we will explore a broad range of texts originating from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. They were written by both Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews hailing from countries as diverse as Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire. Among the authors were pilgrims, rabbis, merchants, and one savvy business woman. We will read their works as responses to historical circumstances and as expressions of Jewish identity, in its changing relationship to the Christian or Muslim environment in which the writers lived or traveled. Specifically, we will ask questions such as: How do travel accounts and autobiographies enable their authors and readers to reflect on issues of identity and difference? How do the writers produce representations of an ""other,"" against which and through which they define a particular sense of self? To what extent are these texts reliable accounts of their authors' personal experiences, and where do they serve their own self-fashioning? How do the writers portray Christians, Muslims, and Jews from other cultural backgrounds than their own? How do they construe the role of women in a world dominated by men? How do they reflect on history, geography, and other fields of knowledge that were not covered by the traditional Jewish curriculum; and how do they respond to the challenges and opportunities of early modernity?

TBA,L23 Re St 4002," This seminar will provide an opportunity to explore in some depth various facets of the convivencia (coexistence) of Muslims, Jews, and Christians in medieval Iberia. We will pick up the timeline with the emergence of an Ibero-Islamic society in the 8th century CE; the seminar's historical horizon stretches up to the turn of the 16th century, when Spanish Jews and Muslims were equally faced with the choice between exile and conversion to Christianity. Until about 1100, Muslims dominated most of the Iberian Peninsula; from then onward, Christians ruled much and eventually all of Spain and Portugal. Through a process termed, from a Christian perspective, as reconquista (Reconquest), Catholic kingdoms acquired large Muslim enclaves. As borders moved, Jewish communities found themselves under varying Muslim or Christian dominion, or migrated from one realm to the other. Interactions between the three ethno-religious communities occurred throughout, some characterized by mutual respect and shared creativity and others by rivalry and strife. The course focuses on these religious and cultural encounters, placing them in various historical and geographic contexts. It will raise questions concerning the ambiguities of religious change, and the interplay of persecution and toleration. Methodologically, the seminar emphasizes the study of primary sources, including documentary, historiographical, literary and poetical texts. Structurally, the course divides into four main parts. Part 1 will cover the political and cultural history of Iberia from the 8th to the early 16th centuries; part 2 will be devoted to the Jewish experience under Muslim rule; and part 3 to the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Christian Spain. In part 4, we will discuss primary sources originating from each of the three communities that are portraying the respective Other. All sources will be read in English translation; however, students are encouraged to make use of their linguistic and cultural expertise acquired in previous classes. This is the capstone seminar for Jewish, Islamic, & Near Eastern Studies majors, Arabic majors, and Hebrew majors.

TBA,L23 Re St 407," Although political action is often considered a problem of making oneself heard, religious practices of silence, self-effacement, and withdrawal from certain worldly struggles have guided many significant political and social movements, particularly forms of non-violent resistance. This course considers the role of religious thought and practice in such movements in the twentieth century. The history of these movements presents an apparent paradox: how can political action emerge from the supposedly ""private"" realm of religion in the modern era, particularly its most individualistic formations in contemplative and mystical practices? Does the historical role of these practices in the political sphere complicate their portrayal in some scholarship as private, individual, and depoliticizing? With these questions animating our investigations, we will consider the work of authors and activists including Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Martin Luther King, Jr., Simone Weil, and William Barber, as well as the history of movements associated with their work. Toward the end of the semester, we will turn to contemporary movements against economic inequality, intimate violence, racially motivated violence, and discrimination toward transgender persons to discuss the use of religious strategies or religiously-derived strategies in current political and social activism.",Solidarity and Silence:Religious Strategies in the Political Sphere,-T-----,3,2:30P-5:30P,Bialek,,1,

The major purpose of the course is to gradually reveal how a city operates internally, and how it operates externally with its sister cities, surrounding metropolitan areas and neighboring states, amidst competing and often contradictory interests. Utilizing historical analysis as a guide, the course will briefly revisit the experiences of previous waves of ethnic groups to the St. Louis metropolitan area, as a lens for understanding the current social, political and economic dilemmas which many urban dwellers in St. Louis now face. The course will reveal to students the intricacies of social welfare issues and policies among high density populations, in St. Louis, that are homogeneous and heterogeneous, at the same time. Visits and discussions with various governmental and nongovernmental agencies, and how such agencies function or dysfunction for various constituencies allow students to ask crucial questions regarding equality of opportunity in a democratic society. Students will also encounter diverse communities and neighborhoods and the intended and unintended consequences of social welfare policies designed to ameliorate urban dilemmas such as poverty and inequality, homelessness, educational underachievement, gentrification, migration and immigration, development, health care, fiscal issues, the informal economy, and issues concerned with crime and social justice, among others.

TBA,L18 URST 299," This course serves as the introductory course analyzing the forces shaping America's cities and surrounding metropolitan areas. It examines as well strategies for dealing with many of the profound social issues affecting urban/metropolitan America. Emanating from an historical perspective, it examines the ways in which industrialization and deindustrialization shaped Northern American cities and the consequences of deindustrialization on urban citizenry. It further surveys the demographic and spatial transformation of American cities examining the consequences of urban transformation on federal, state and local politics, on society and on her institutions. Similarly, the course focuses on the origin and societal changes and emerging goals of urban development, gentrification and evolving patterns of metropolitanism and the necessity for central city as well as neighborhood reconstruction. The dynamics of racial residential segregation, crime and punishment, issues of academic achievement and under-achievement, the social cleavages of urban marginalized communities, family structure, urban homelessness, urban sprawl, and health care, among others, are viewed from the perspective of social justice by exploring social, political, economic, racial, and ethnic factors that impact on access, equity and care. Various theoretical perspectives and philosophies are introduced that have dominated the discourse on race and urban poverty. A field based component complements the coursework, and is designed to build interest, awareness and skills in preparation for outreach to urban communities.

We must work to lift people who are underserved; we must expand the range of abilities for those who are caught in only one kind of training; and we must each learn to be creative thinkers contributing our abilities to many sectors of our society. In this course, we expand our views about learning by experimenting with the creative process of lateral thinking. In the first six weeks of the semester, we will learn about learning by meeting with exceptional people with many scholarly, professional, and civic engagement accomplishments. We also learn by working in teams to develop an exciting set of 2-D / 3-D, hands-on, problem-solving workshops for middle-schoolers from economically disadvantaged urban families; the workshop curriculum is be based upon your knowledge and passion as well as your interests. During the last eight weeks, we deliver these workshops once a week to students at Compton-Drew Middle School (adjacent to the Science Center in the city of St. Louis).

Second, the course emphasizes the skills related to the exercise of policy analysis. These skills include the crafting of technical documents within the field of public policy (e.g. a policy brief) and the application of scientific methods to the exploration of social problems/governmental actions. Likely issues related to this course feature include the use of scientific knowledge in political arenas, engagement with stakeholders and the intended/unintended consequences of policy science to political decision-making. Third, this course simulates the policymaking context through students' participation in mock congressional testimonies.

In this course, we will explore the sexual politics of film noir as a distinctive vision of American sexual relations every bit as identifiable as the form's stylized lighting and circuitous storytelling. We will explore how and why sexual paranoia and perversion seem to animate this genre and why these movies continue to influence ""neo-noir"" filmmaking into the 21st century, even as film noir's representation of gender and sexuality is inseparable from its literary antecedents, most notably, the so-called ""hard-boiled"" school of writing. We will read examples from this literature by Dashiell Hammett, James Cain, Raymond Chandler and Cornell Woolrich, and discuss these novels and short stories in the context of other artistic and cultural influences on gendered power relations and film noir.

We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context. We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives. For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (or women and men) use the law to gain greater equality? What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality? What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists? How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women.

This course examines several ways that people have theorized pleasure as a space for politics, a space for conservatism, or a way to think about racialized difference. This course is not interested in defining what pleasure is, but it interrogates what the stakes of talking about pleasure have been within contemporary theory and culture. Beginning with an examination of pleasure in the context of early twentieth century sexology, this course looks at the sex wars of the 1970s, the turn toward pleasure as a space of protest, and ends by thinking of ways to imagine pleasure outside of current paradigms of sexuality. The course takes gender, race, and sexuality as central analytic components to understand how pleasure is defined and who has access to it.

McMillan / 221,L77 WGSS 417W," Research is the foundation of academic knowledge and of much knowledge produced outside of the academy in think tanks, non-profit organizations, social service agencies, corporations, and many other venues of economic and social activity. Informed by theory, and shaped by specific methods, research can and does help to frame problems, contribute to policymaking, and evaluate the effectiveness of policies and programs. Research is employed in a variety of ways in the different disciplines within the academy and within different practices outside of the academy. This course examines the different ways in which research is conducted and examines the reasons for these differences and the ways in which they contribute to or hamper feminist goals. The course also explores the ways in which some research methods are privileged over others in hegemonic understandings of what counts as ""research"" and of what counts as ""knowledge."" The course examines how gender theory and feminist politics shape the kinds of research questions researchers ask, the types of materials and other information researchers use, and the ways researchers define our relationships with our sources of data, evidence, and other information. Students are expected to reflect on and engage with feminist approaches to research in this course in order to develop and complete a detailed research proposal. Prerequisite: At least 2 courses in WGSS, including Introduction to WGSS or Sexuality Studies at the 100 or 200-levels and one 300-level WGSS course, preferably in feminist or queer theory. This class is a writing intensive course.",Feminist Research Methodologies,M------,3,2:30P-5:30P,Dzuback,,1,

African American women have been particularly concerned with this question, as the stories and pictures circulated about black female identity have had a profound impact on their understandings of themselves and political discourse. In this course we will look at how black feminist theorists from a variety of intellectual traditions have explored the impact of theories of identity on our world. We will look at their discussions of slavery, colonialism, sexuality, motherhood, citizenship, and what it means to be human.",From Mammy to the Welfare Queen: African American Women Theorize Identity,M-W----,3,10:00A-11:30A,Wanzo,,1,
TBA,L77 WGSS 4231," This course builds on the new interest in whiteness studies, which assumes that whiteness and masculinity are social constructions rather than ""natural"" identities. Moving from about 1830 to 1925, we will explore the development of a deeply contested discourse of ""national manhood"" in the United States, as it emerges in historically specific circumstances. How does whiteness intersect with related discourses of gender, sexuality, and social class? Beginning with the apocalyptic poetry and prose of Edgar Allan Poe, we will examine terrorized whiteness as an identifying feature of normative masculinity in the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, Henry James, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Do these authors claim the power to resist threats to their individual autonomy? To what extent do they experience masculine self-reliance as a myth? How do they imagine meaningful communities? Addressing these social issues and related aesthetic questions, we will venture, as Whitman says, ""in paths untrodden."" Students will write three papers of increasing complexity and there will be shorter writing assignments as well. Class attendance and active participation are required, naturally!

What are the most effective ways to bridge the innovations of the research university with the everyday work of practitioners seeking to prevent violence or intervene in its aftermath? What are the ethics involved in constructing tools for public and professional use? Which interests should govern the choices in content, design, and dissemination of information? This course will introduce students to the strategies and challenges of devising technological tools for violence prevention for use beyond the classroom. Class readings and discussions will be supplemented by hands-on project work with Washington University's Gender Violence Database and lab sessions that focus on skill-building in digital project construction.

TBA,L77 WGSS 437," This course engages contemporary feminist theories from diverse transnational contexts, as well as the social movements and local resistances they inspire. Through engagement with key works of feminist theory, political manifestos, and creative works of resistance, we will explore how transnational feminist alliances and coalitions have contested and responded to gendered and racialized forms of exploitation, navigating and reshaping territorial and social boundaries. We will engage with debates around the notion of a ""global sisterhood""; tensions between universal and local feminist practice; the role of difference, nationality and culture in navigating the possibility of solidarity; the role of the Internet in forging cross-border alliances; human rights-based activism; ""women's"" work; transgender inclusivity and transfeminisms. Part of our goal will be to ask how feminist theories from diverse geographical locations have influenced the politics of borders, movements for environmental justice, migrations and mobility, resistance to imperialism and the forging of alternative economies. We will also explore the gray areas existing in between binaries such as feminist/anti-feminist; local/global; home/away; global South/North; victim/agent; domination/dependency. Finally, we will ask how processes of knowledge-production take shape within different intellectual and political movements such as post-colonial feminism, decolonial and indigenous feminism, liberal and radical feminism, Marxist feminism and religiously-based feminisms.",Transnational Feminisms,M-W----,3,2:30P-4:00P,[TBA],,1,
TBA,L77 WGSS 482," Although women of premodern China have often been portrayed as little more than long-suffering victims of male patriarchy and sexual repression, their lives were far more complicated, diverse, and interesting. Women played roles as filial daughters, dutiful wives, and devoted mothers, but also as proud courtesans, clever entrepreneurs, educated scholars and teachers, independent nuns, fierce warriors and even powerful rulers. In this course we will begin with a broad overview of the ideal traditional roles for women established in early China. We will then move on to a general exploration of some of the ways women were represented in classical literature by male writers. Our main focus, however, will be on how, over time, more and more women took up the brush and began to write themselves. In so doing they were able to express their own subjectivity and often radically reinscribe many of the notions of femininity and of female roles that were dominant during their times. We will conclude with a discussion of ways in which traditional women writers both anticipated and contributed to the 20th century transition to modernity. Most of our class discussion will be based on primary sources in English translation, supplemented by occasional secondary critical scholarly articles where relevant. Prerequisite: Some background in premodern Chinese literature history or culture would be helpful but is not required.",Reading Seminar in Gender and Chinese Literature: Writing Women of Imperial China,-T-R---,3,1:00P-2:30P,Grant,,1,

In the case of all of these debates, we will examine the ideas justifying each of the contributory positions and challenge students to develop their own positions.Prerequisites: Prior coursework in feminist theory or permission of instructor.",Advanced Feminist Theory,-T-----,3,2:30P-5:30P,Nicholson,,1,
TBA,L13 Writing 103," This class seeks to develop the advanced reading, writing, and research skills that students need in a university setting. It uses classical texts of the western tradition to investigate the question of justice and to develop arguable claims through the careful analysis of evidence. The act of crafting arguments, we will assume, is implicated in the question of justice because arguments depend on an ethics of persuasion. We will learn how to practice such an ethics as we improve our ability to understand and utilize four crucial aspects of academic writing: evidence, analysis, argument, and research. Mastering these aspects will make us proficient in the difficult art of judgment. It will allow us to make sense of some of the most powerful literary statements about justice, from ""Antigone"" to ""Crime and Punishment,"" from Shakespeare to Toni Morrison.

TBA,L13 Writing 205," In our modern world, we are bombarded by images on a daily basis-graffiti artists ""tag"" our brick buildings; billboards line our highways; models stare back at us from the pages of glossy magazines; photos and video of injustice and violence, peaceful protest and civil disobedience, confront us on social media; vapid images flash endlessly on our television and computer screens. But what is our role within this visual culture? Are we passive spectators or active participants? How does our personal, social, or cultural situation shape what and how we see and experience the world? Throughout this course, students will explore these (and other) questions by drawing from a wide range of discourse communities and genres, including (but not limited to) art history, psychology, sociology, cultural studies, memoir, nonfiction, and creative writing. Readings and assignments are designed to enhance students' awareness of the relationship between writing and their observations and experiences of the visual world. Essay assignments will enable students to explore the visual world and their personal interest in related subjects (such as art, film, social media, and advertising). The course includes one personal essay, two expository essays, and one argumentative essay, as well as peer review workshops, oral presentation, and revision. Additionally, students will prepare for essay assignments by generating ideas and experimenting with form and style through a series of in-class writing exercises.",Writing the Visual World,M-W----,3,10:00A-11:30A,Daniels,,1,
TBA,L13 Writing 212," The study of rhetoric, one of the original seven Liberal Arts, is perhaps more relevant today, in a world where diverse opinions reverberate 24/7 from television and the internet, than in ancient times when rhetors invented arguments to help people choose the best course of action when they disagreed about important political, religious, or social issues. How do we make our voices heard? How can we invent and present compelling written discourse. This course will introduce students to common rhetorical principles and to the disciplinary history of rhetoric and compositional studies. Assignments in this class include rhetorical exercise in invention and craft, imitations, and varied compositions, ranging from the personal to critical, from the biographical to argumentative. We will examine rhetorical principles (audience, context, kairos, exigency, ethos, pathos, logos, and so forth) that are employed, for example, not only in literary analysis but in law, politics, education, and science.

TBA,L13 Writing 314," Most legal practice consists not of fine oratory but rather of great writing. However, it is not only lawyers who need to be able to incorporate the law into their professional practice: in this course, we will look at the many different types of writing in and about the law to see how the principles of rhetoric must be used to persuade in different ways depending on the writer's purpose. We will learn the skills necessary to adapt the framing of our writing to its audience as we think about how we might persuade a judge, a lay client, a community, a committee or other professionals. We will consider the psychological effects of our writing and how we seek to persuade our readers not only with the strength of our reasoning but with the power of our emotional appeal to their particular interests. We will learn how to think and write about the law in a range of circumstances as assignments cover writing for business about implications of laws, reporting about a law for the popular press, investigating a legal issue and explaining a law's ramifications as well as attempting to encourage support for a particular law; this is not, however, a technical legal writing course. Readings will be drawn from statutes and judgments but more commonly from academic, business and popular examples of writing on the interpretation of laws governing topical concerns. Issues to be dealt with may include the extent of police/citizens' rights to protect themselves (so-called Stand Your Ground laws); rights to refuse medical treatment (Cruzan v Director, Missouri Dept of Health); religious groups' rights to discriminate (The Religious Freedom Restoration Act); Open Carry laws (St. Louis Zoo v Smith); immigration proposals such as The Dream Act; reform of mandatory prison sentences.",Topics in Composition: Writing and the Law,M-W----,3,11:30A-1:00P,Thomas,,1,

TBA,L13 Writing 375," Defined most simply, politics pertains to the ""affairs of the polis,"" one's community. In its real-life context, writing always interacts with a community, engaging a defined audience to create an intended effect. So writing always pertains to the polis, and thus, writing is inherently political. In this class, we will focus on political writing by writers who are not politicians, that is to say, official experts on the polis. Foregoing public policy memoranda and economic analyses, we will look at how journalists, grassroots organizers, and creative writers have consciously written to intervene in the affairs of their communities despite their outsider status. Using rhetorical insight and logical analysis, we will examine how writers craft works that inspire and move audiences in several genres: essay, polemic, journalism, and satire. Readings will include Marx and Engels's ""Communist Manifesto,"" Audre Lorde's essays on feminism, Hunter Thompson's gonzo journalism, and the satire of Samantha Bee.

The course will be part survey, part workshop. The workshop aspect will entail writing two different works within the genre, chosen from among the various types of critical writing we survey. For the survey aspect, we'll read book reviews to manifestos to book-length poetic-critical hybrids. The goal is not really compare-and-contrasting but rather considering each form within its rhetorical context and seeing what we can learn. We might look at how a single writer handles various subjects, and at how various writers handle a single subject. Writers likely to be read include Susan Howe, James Baldwin, Dave Hickey, Anne Carson, William Carlos Williams, Susan Sontag, James Wood, E. A. Poe, and Viktor Shklovsky.

Students can apply in the spring of their first year, to begin the internship the following fall. The intern chosen will work directly with Danielle Dutton, the press's editor, on mutually agreed upon projects that take into account the intern's interests and strengths. In general, however, the internship is designed to give students a wide range of experience with literary publishing, and so will likely involve a mix of editorial tasks (e.g., reviewing submissions, writing reader's reports, copyediting manuscripts in layout), marketing, design, and book production and distribution. The intern will also have opportunities to represent the press publicly, including at the annual AWP conference (travel and hotel expenses will be covered), and his or her name will appear on the press's masthead. Interested students should submit a letter of application and CV to Professor Dutton (ddutton@wustl.edu) and Program Director David Schuman (dschuman@wustl.edu) no later than March 15 of the spring semester of their first year.

We'll consider a wide variety of contemporary fiction (as well as some poems and a couple of plays) which can be roughly divided into four groups, two of which primarily appropriate story elements, as well as style and voice--adaptations and inhabitations (if an adaptation lives within and transforms the house of a prior text, an inhabitation perhaps builds or discovers new rooms)--and two of which primarily appropriate actual text and language--condensations (new fictions constructed as radically abridged versions of prior texts) and assemblages. We'll also consider ""uncreative writing,"" in Kenneth Goldsmith's term; we'll draw connections to appropriation theory and practice in the visual arts; and we'll discuss evolving notions of authorship and personal expression in a contemporary, digital landscape. Authors will likely include Caroline Bergvall, Kate Bernheimer, Jorge Luis Borges, Angela Carter, Aim Csaire, Lydia Davis, Kate Durbin, Danielle Dutton, Goldsmith, Shelley Jackson, Jonathan Lethem, Jean Rhys, and Tom Stoppard.
